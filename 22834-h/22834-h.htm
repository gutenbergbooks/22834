<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">None</span> of the minor incidents in our naval history has
inspired so many writers as the Mutiny of the <i>Bounty</i>.
Histories, biographies and romances, from Bligh's narrative
in 1790 to Mr. Becke's "Mutineers" in 1898, have been
founded upon it; Byron took it for the theme of the
least happy of his dramatic poems; and all these, not
because the mutiny left any mark upon history, but
because it ranks first among the stories of the sea, instinct
with the living elements of romance, of primal passion
and of tragedy&mdash;all moving to a happy ending in the
Arcadia of Pitcairn Island. And yet, while every incident
in the moving story, even to the evidence in the
famous court-martial, has been discussed over and over
again, there has been lying in the Record Office for more
than a century an autograph manuscript, written by one
of the principal actors in the drama, which no one has
thought it worth while to print.</p>

<p>Though the story of the mutiny is too well known to
need repeating in detail, it is necessary to set forth as
briefly as possible its relation to the history of maritime
discovery in the Pacific. In the year 1787, ten years
after the death of Captain Cook in Hawaii, a number of
West India merchants in London, stirred by the glowing
reports of the natural wealth of the South Sea Islands
brought home by Dampier and Cook, petitioned the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>government to acclimatize the bread-fruit in Jamaica.
A ship of 215 tons was purchased into the service and
fitted out under the direct superintendence of Sir Joseph
Banks, who named her the <i>Bounty</i>, and recommended
William Bligh, one of Cook's officers, for the command. It
was a new departure. The object of most of the earlier
government expeditions to the South Seas had been the
advancement of geographical science and natural history;
the voyage of the <i>Bounty</i> was to turn former discoveries
to the profit of the empire.</p>

<p>Bligh was singularly ill-fitted for the command. While
he had undoubted ability, his whole career shows him to
have been wanting in the tact and temper without which
no one can successfully lead men; and in this venture
his own defects were aggravated by the inefficiency of his
officers. He took in his cargo of bread-fruit trees at
Tahiti, and there was no active insubordination until
he reached Tonga on the homeward voyage. At sunrise
on April 28th, 1789, the crew mutinied under the leadership
of Fletcher Christian, the Master's Mate, whom
Bligh's ungoverned temper had provoked beyond endurance.
The seamen had other motives. Bligh had kept
them far too long at Tahiti, and during the five months
they had spent at the island, every man had formed a
connection among the native women, and had enjoyed
a kind of life that contrasted sharply with the lot of
bluejackets a century ago. Forcing Bligh, and such of
their shipmates as were loyal to him, into the launch,
and casting them adrift with food and water barely
sufficient for a week's subsistence, they set the ship's
course eastward, crying "Huzza for Tahiti!" There
followed an open boat voyage that is unexampled in
maritime history. The boat was only 23 feet long; the
weight of eighteen men sank her almost to the gunwale;
the ocean before them was unknown, and teeming with
hidden dangers; their only arms against hostile natives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>
were a few cutlasses, their only food two ounces of biscuit
each a day; and yet they ran 3618 nautical miles in
forty-one days, and reached Timor with the loss of only
one man, and he was killed by the natives at the very
outset.</p>

<p>The mutineers fared as mutineers have always fared.
Having sailed the ship to Tahiti, they fell out among
themselves, half taking the <i>Bounty</i> to the uninhabited
island of Pitcairn, where they were discovered
twenty-seven years later, and half remaining at Tahiti.
Of these two were murdered, four were drowned in the
wreck of the <i>Pandora</i>, three were hanged in England,
and six were pardoned, one living to become a post-captain
in the navy, another to be gunner on the <i>Blenheim</i>
when she foundered with Sir Thomas Troubridge.</p>

<p>One boat voyage only is recorded as being longer than
Bligh's. In 1536 Diego Botelho Pereira made the passage
from Portuguese India to Lisbon in a native <i>fusta</i>, or
lateen rigged boat, but a little larger than Bligh's. He
had, however, covered her with a deck, and provisioned
her for the venture, and he was able to replenish his
stock at various points on the voyage.</p>

<p>In 1790 the publication of Bligh's account of his
sufferings excited the strongest public sympathy, and the
Admiralty lost no time in fitting out an expedition to
search for the mutineers, and bring them home to punishment.
The <i>Pandora</i>, frigate, of 24 guns, was commissioned
for the purpose, and manned by 160 men,
composed largely of landsmen, for every trained seaman
in the navy had gone to man the great fleet then assembling
at Portsmouth under Lord Howe. Captain Edward
Edwards, the officer chosen for the command, had a high
reputation as a seaman and a disciplinarian, and from
the point of view of the Admiralty, who intended the cruise
simply as a police mission without any scientific object,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>
no better choice could have been made. Their orders to
him were to proceed to Tahiti, and, not finding the
mutineers there, to visit the different groups of the
Society and Friendly Islands, and the others in the
neighbouring parts of the Pacific, using his best endeavours
to seize and bring home in confinement the
whole, or such part of the delinquents as he might be
able to discover. "You are," the orders ran, "to keep
the mutineers as closely confined as may preclude all
possibility of their escaping, having, however, proper
regard to the preservation of their lives, that they may
be brought home to undergo the punishment due to their
demerits." Edwards belonged to that useful class of
public servant that lives upon instructions. With a
roving commission in an ocean studded with undiscovered
islands the possibilities of scientific discovery were
immense, but he faced them like a blinkered horse that
has his eyes fixed on the narrow track before him, and
all the pleasant byways of the road shut out. A cold,
hard man, devoid of sympathy and imagination, of every
interest beyond the straitened limits of his profession,
Edwards in the eye of posterity was almost the worst
man that could have been chosen. For, with a different
commander, the voyage would have been one of the most
important in the history of South Sea discovery, and the
account he has written of it compares in style and colour
with a log-book.</p>

<p>In Edwards' place a more genial man, a Catoira, a
Wallis, or a Cook, would have written a journal of discovery
that might have taken a place in the front rank
of the literature of travel. He would have investigated
the murder of La P&eacute;rouse's boat's crew in Tutuila on the
spot; he would have rescued the survivors of that ill-fated
expedition whose smoke-signals he saw on Vanikoro;
he would have brought home news of the great Fiji group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>
through which Bligh passed in the <i>Bounty's</i> launch; he
might even have discovered Fletcher Christian's colony of
mutineers in Pitcairn. But, on the other hand, humanity
to his prisoners might have furnished them with the means
of escape, and his ardour for discovery might have led
him into dangers from which no one would have survived
to tell the tale. Edwards had the qualities of his defects.
If he treated his prisoners harshly, he prevented them from
contaminating his crew, and brought the majority of them
home alive through all the perils of shipwreck and famine.
In all the attacks that have been made upon him there is
not a word against his character as a plain, straight-forward
officer, who could lick a crew of landsmen into
shape, and keep them loyal to him through the stress of
shipwreck and privation. If he was callous to the sufferings
of his prisoners, he was at least as indifferent to his
own. If he felt no sympathy with others, he asked for
none with himself. If he won no love, he compelled
respect.</p>

<p>Of his officers little need be said. Corner, the first
lieutenant, was a stout seaman, who bottled up his disapproval
of his captain's behaviour until the commission
was out. Hayward, the second lieutenant, was a time-server.
He had been a midshipman on the <i>Bounty</i> at the
time of the mutiny, and an intimate friend of young Peter
Heywood who was constrained to cast in his lot with the
mutineers, yet, when Heywood gave himself up on the
arrival of the <i>Pandora</i> at Tahiti, his old comrade, now
risen in the world, received him with a haughty stare.
Of Larkin, Passmore, and the rest, we know nothing.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, the <i>Pandora</i> carried a certain rollicking,
irresponsible person as surgeon. George Hamilton
has been called "a coarse, vulgar, and illiterate man, more
disposed to relate licentious scenes and adventures, in
which he and his companions were engaged, than to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>
any information of proceedings and occurrences connected
with the main object of the voyage." From this puritanical
criticism most readers will dissent. Hamilton was
bred in Northumberland, and was at this time past forty.
His portrait, the frontispiece to his book, represents him
in the laced coat and powdered wig of the period, a man
of middle age, with clever, well-cut features, and a large,
humorous, and rather sensual mouth. His book, with all
its faults of scandalous plain speech, is one that few naval
surgeons of that day could have written. The style,
though flippant, is remarkable for a cynical but always
good-natured humour, and on the rare occasions when he
thought it professionally incumbent on him to be serious,
as in his discussion of the best dietary for long voyages,
and the physical effects of privations, his remarks display
observation and good sense. It must be admitted, I fear,
that he relates certain of his own and his shipmates'
adventures ashore with shameless gusto, but he wrote in
an age that loved plain speech, and that did not care to
veil its appetite for licence. Like Edwards, he tells us
little of the prisoners after they were consigned to "Pandora's
Box." His narrative is valuable as a commentary
on Edwards' somewhat meagre report, and for the sidelights
which it throws upon the manners of naval officers
of those days. Even Edwards, to whom he is always
loyal, does not escape his little shaft of satire when he
relates how the stern captain was driven to conduct
prayers in the most desperate portion of the boat voyage.
His book, published at Berwick in 1793, has now become
so rare that Mr. Quaritch lately advertised for it three
times without success, and therefore no excuse is needed
for reprinting it.</p>

<p>The <i>Pandora</i> was dogged by ill luck from the first. An
epidemic fever raging in England at the time of her
departure, was introduced on board, it was thought, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>
infected clothing. The sick bay, and indeed, the officers'
cabins, too, were crammed with stores intended for the
return voyage of the <i>Bounty</i>, and there was no accommodation
for the sick. Hamilton attributes their recovery
to the use of tea and sugar, then carried for the first time
in a ship of war. He gives some interesting information
regarding the precautions taken against scurvy. They had
essence of malt and hops for brewing beer, a mill for grinding
wheat, the meal being eaten with brown sugar, and as
much saurkraut as the crew chose to eat.</p>

<p>The first land sighted after rounding Cape Horn, was
Ducie's island; probably the same island which, as the
Encarnacion of Quiros, has dodged about the charts of
the old geographers, swelling into a continent, contracting
into an atoll, and finally coming to rest in the
neighbourhood of the Solomon Islands before vanishing
for ever. The <i>Pandora</i> was now in the latitude of Pitcairn,
which lay down wind only three hundred miles distant.
If she had but kept a westerly course, she must
have sighted it, for the island's peak is visible for many
leagues, but relentless ill fortune turned her northward,
and during the ensuing day she passed the men she was
in search of scarce thirty leagues away. One glimmer of
good fortune awaited Edwards in Tahiti. The schooner
built by the mutineers was ready for sea, but not provisioned
for a voyage. She put to sea, and outsailed the
<i>Pandora's</i> boat that went in chase of her, but her crew,
dreading the inevitable starvation that faced them, put
back during the night and took to the mountains, where
they were all captured.</p>

<p>In the matter of "Pandora's Box," there were excuses
for Edwards, who was bitterly attacked afterwards for his
inhumanity. One of the chiefs had warned him that there
was a plot between the natives and the mutineers to cut
the cable of the <i>Pandora</i> in the night. Most of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
mutineers were connected through their women with
influential chiefs, and nothing was more likely than that
such a rescue should be attempted. His own crew, moreover,
were human. They could see for themselves the
charms of a life in Tahiti; they could hear from the
prisoners the consideration in which Englishmen were held
in this delightful land. What had been possible in the
<i>Bounty</i> was possible in the <i>Pandora</i>. Edwards regarded his
prisoners as pirates, desperate with the weight of the rope
about their necks. His orders were definite&mdash;to consider
nothing but the preservation of their lives&mdash;and he did
his duty in his own way according to his lights. And that
he was not insensible to every feeling of humanity is
shown by the fact that he allowed the native wives of the
mutineers daily access to their husbands while the ship
lay there. The infinitely pathetic story of poor "Peggy,"
the beautiful Tahitian girl who had borne a child to midshipman
Stewart, was vouched for six years later by the
missionaries of the "Duff." She had to be separated
from her husband by force, and it was at his request that
she was not again admitted to the ship. Poor girl! it
was all her life to her. A month before her boy-husband
perished in the wreck of the <i>Pandora</i>, she had died of a
broken heart, leaving her baby, the first half-caste born
in Tahiti, to be brought up by the missionaries.</p>

<p>"Pandora's Box" certainly needed some excuse. A
round house, eleven feet long, accessible only through a
scuttle in the roof, was built upon the quarter deck as a
prison for the fourteen mutineers, who were ironed and
handcuffed. Hamilton says that the roundhouse was
built partly out of consideration for the prisoners themselves,
in order to spare them the horrors of prolonged
imprisonment below in the tropics, and that although the
service regulations restricted prisoners to two-thirds allowance,
Edwards rationed them exactly like the ship's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[<a href="./images/9.png">9</a>]</span>
company. Morrison, however, who seems to have
belonged to that objectionable class of seamen&mdash;the
sea-lawyer&mdash;having kept a journal of grievances against
Bligh when on the <i>Bounty</i>, and preserved it even in
"Pandora's Box," gives a very different account, and
Peter Heywood, a far more trustworthy witness, declared
in a letter to his mother, that they were kept "with both
hands and both legs in irons, and were obliged to eat,
drink, sleep, and obey the calls of nature, without ever
being allowed to get out of this den."</p>

<p>Edwards now provisioned the mutineers' little schooner,
and put on board of her a prize crew of two petty officers
and seven men to navigate her as his tender. For the
first few weeks, while the scent was keen, he maintained
a very active search for the <i>Bounty</i>. He had three clues:
first, the mention of Aitutaki in a story the mutineers had
told the natives to account for their reappearance;
second, a report made to him by Hillbrant, one of his
prisoners, that Christian, on the night before he left
Tahiti, had declared his intention of settling on Duke of
York's Island; and third, the discovery on Palmerston
Island of the <i>Bounty's</i> driver yard, much worm-eaten from
long immersion. It must be confessed that hopes founded
on these clues did little credit to Edwards' intelligence.
Aitutaki, having been discovered by Bligh, was the last
place Christian would have chosen: he might have
guessed that a man of Christian's intelligence would
intentionally have given a false account of his projects
to the mutineers he left behind, knowing that even if all
who were set adrift in the boat had perished, the story of
the mutiny would be learned by the first ship that visited
Tahiti; a worm-eaten spar lying on the tide-mark, at an
island situated directly down-wind from the Society
Islands, so far from proving that the <i>Bounty</i> had been
there, indicated the exact contrary. But it is to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
remembered that at this time the islands known to exist
in the Pacific could almost be counted on the fingers, and
that Edwards could not have hoped, within the limits of
a single cruise, to examine even the half of those that
were marked in his chart. Had he suspected the existence
of the vast number of islands around him, he would at
once have realised the hopelessness of attempting to discover
the hiding-place of an able navigator bent on concealment.
Whether, as has been suggested by one writer,<a name="FNanchor_10-1" id="FNanchor_10-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_10-1" class="fnanchor">[10-1]</a>
Christian was piloted to Pitcairn by his Tahitian companions,
of whom some were descended from the old
native inhabitants, or had read of it in Carteret's voyage
in 1767, or had chanced upon it by accident, he could have
followed no wiser course than to steer eastward, and upwind,
for any vessel despatched to arrest him would
perforce go first to Tahiti for information, when it would
be too late to beat to the eastward without immense loss
of time.</p>

<p>From Aitutaki Edwards bore north-west to investigate
the second clue, and in the Union Group he made his first
important discovery of new land&mdash;Nukunono, inhabited
by a branch of the Micronesian race, crossed with Polynesian
blood. From thence he ran southward to Samoa,
where he came upon traces of the massacre of La P&eacute;rouse's
second in command, M. de Langle, in the shape of accoutrements
cut from the uniforms of the French officers.
Consistent with his usual concentration upon the object
of his voyage, he does not seem to have cared to make
enquiries about them.</p>

<p>At this stage in the voyage there occurred an accident
which, from our point of view, must be regarded as the
most fortunate incident of the voyage. The tender, very
imperfectly victualled, parted company in a thick shower
of rain. At this date Fiji, the most important group in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>
the South Pacific, was practically unknown. Tasman had
sighted its north-eastern extremity: Cook had discovered
Vatoa, an outlying island in the far southward, and had
heard of it from the Tongans in his second voyage when he
had not time to look for it; Bligh had passed through the
heart of it in his boat voyage, and had even been chased
by two canoes from Round Island, Yasawa; but no European
had landed or held any intercourse with the natives.
It is not easy to understand how islands of such magnitude
as Fiji should have remained undiscovered so long after
every other important group in the Pacific had found its
place in the charts of the Pacific. They were known by
repute; Hamilton writes of "the savage and cannibal
Feegees"; they lay but two days' sail down-wind from
Tonga. Three years before the <i>Pandora's</i> cruise the Pacific
had been thrown open to the sperm whale fishery, which
has had so large a part in South Sea discovery, by the
cruise of the English ship <i>Amelia</i>, fitted out by Enderby;
and yet neither ship of war nor whaler had chanced upon
them. But for a meagre passage in Edwards' journal, and
a traditionary poem in the Fijian language, we should not
know to whom belongs the honour of first visiting them.
The native tradition sets forth that with the first visit of
a European ship a devastating sickness, called the Great
Lila, or "Wasting Sickness," attacked the people of one
of the Eastern Islands (of the Lau group), and, spreading
from island to island, swept away vast numbers of the
people. There are, it may be remarked, innumerable
instances in history of the contact between continental and
island peoples, both of them healthy at the time of contact,
producing fatal epidemics among the islanders. Even
among our own Hebrides the natives are said to look for
an outbreak of "Strangers' Cold" after every visit of a
ship. The Fijian tradition certainly dates from a few
years before the beginning of the last century.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
The real discoverers of Fiji seem to have been Oliver,
master's mate; Renouard, midshipman; James Dodds,
quartermaster, and six seamen of the <i>Pandora</i>, who formed
the crew of Edwards' tender; and surely no ship that ever
ventured among those dangerous islands was so ill furnished
for repelling attack. Edwards had sent provisions and ammunition
on board of her when off Palmerston Island, but
by this time they were exhausted, and a fresh supply was
actually on the <i>Pandora's</i> deck when she parted company.
Her provision for the long and dangerous voyage before
her was a bag of salt, a bag of nails and ironware, a
boarding netting, and several seven-barrelled pieces and
blunderbusses. She had besides the latitude and longitude
of the places the <i>Pandora</i> would touch at.</p>

<p>The following account of their cruise is drawn from the
remarks of Edwards and Hamilton on finding the tender
safe in Samarang, for I have searched the Record Office
in vain for Oliver's log. If he kept any, it was not thought
worth preserving. On the night the tender parted company,
the 22nd June, 1791, the natives of the south-east
end of Upolu made a determined attack upon the little
vessel with their canoes. The seven-barrelled pieces made
terrible havoc among them, but, never having seen fire-arms,
and not understanding the connection between the
fall of their comrades and the report, they kept up the
attack with great fury. But for the boarding netting they
would easily have taken the schooner, and indeed, one
fellow succeeded in springing over it, and would have felled
Oliver with his club had he not been shot dead at the
moment of striking. On the 23rd they cruised about in
search of the <i>Pandora</i> until the afternoon when, having
drunk their last drop of water, they gave her up, and made
sail for Namuka, the appointed rendezvous. The torture
they suffered from thirst on the passage was such that
poor Renouard, the midshipman, became delirious, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>
continued so for many weeks. Their leeway and the
easterly current combined to set them to the westward
of Namuka, and the first land they made was <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Tofua'">Tofoa</ins>,
which they mistook for Namuka, their rendezvous. The
natives, the same that had attacked Bligh so treacherously
two years before, sold them provisions and water, and
then made an attempt to take the vessel, and would have
succeeded but for the fire-arms. On the very day of the
attack the <i>Pandora</i> dropped anchor at Namuka, within
sight of Tofoa, and not finding her tender, bore down upon
that island. Had Oliver been able to wait there for her,
his troubles would have been at an end. But he dared
not take the risk, and when Edwards sent a boat ashore
to make enquiries the little schooner had sailed. The
reception accorded to Edwards at Tofoa is very characteristic
of the Tongans. Lieutenant Hayward, who had
been present at the attack made upon Bligh, recognised
several of the murderers of Norton among the people who
crowded on board to do homage to the great chief, Fatafehi,
who had taken passage in the frigate, but Edwards
dared not punish them for fear that his tender should
fall among them after he had left. Had he but known
that these men had come red-handed from a treacherous
attack upon the tender; that Fatafehi, who so loudly
condemned their treachery to Bligh, and assured him
that nothing had been seen of the little vessel, had just
heard of the abortive attack they had made upon her, he
would have taught them a lesson that would have lasted
the Tongans many years, and might have saved the lives
of the Europeans who perished in the taking of the
<i>Port-au-Prince</i> and the <i>Duke of Portland</i>. For these
"Norsemen of the Pacific," whom Cook, knowing nothing
of the treachery they had planned against him under the
guise of hospitality, misnamed the "Friendly Islanders,"
were, in reality, a nation of wreckers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
Leaving Tofoa about July 1st, the schooner ran westward
for two days "nearly in its latitude," and fell in
with an island which Edwards supposed to be one of the
Fiji group. The island of the Fiji group that lies most
nearly in the latitude of Tofoa is Vatoa, discovered by
Cook, but there are strong reasons for seeking Oliver's
discoveries elsewhere. Vatoa lies only 170 miles from
Tofoa, and, therefore, if Oliver took two days in reaching
it, he cannot have been running at more than three knots
an hour. But, early in July, the south-east trade wind
is at its strongest, and with a fair wind a fast sailer, as
we know the schooner to have been, cannot have been
travelling at a slower rate than six knots. We are further
told that Oliver waited five weeks at the island, and
took in provisions and water. Now, in July, which is
the middle of the dry season, no water is to be found on
Vatoa except a little muddy and fetid liquid at the bottom
of shallow wells which the natives, who rely upon coconuts
for drinking water, only use for cooking. Provisions
also are very scarce there at all times. The same objections
apply to Ongea and Fulanga which lie fifty miles
north of Vatoa, in the same longitude, though they
certainly possess harbours in which a vessel could lie
for five weeks, which Vatoa does not. If, however, the
schooner ran at the rate of six knots, as may safely be
assumed, all difficulties, except that of latitude, vanish
together, for at the distance of 290 nautical miles from
Tofoa lies Matuku, which with much justification has been
described by Wilkes as the most beautiful of all the islands
in the Pacific. There the natives live in perpetual plenty
among perennial streams, and could victual the largest
ship without feeling any diminution of their stock. In
the harbour three frigates could lie in perfect safety, and
the people have earned a reputation for honesty and
hospitality to passing ships which belongs to the inhabi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>tants
of none of the large islands. There is another
alternative&mdash;Kandavu&mdash;but to reach that island, the
schooner must have run at an average of eleven knots,
and the number and cupidity of the natives would have
made a stay of five weeks impossible to a vessel so poorly
manned and armed.</p>

<p>All these considerations point to the fact that Oliver lay
for five weeks at Matuku, which lies but fifty miles north
of the latitude of Tofoa. He was, therefore, the first
European who had intercourse with the Fijians. Their
traditions have never been collected, and if one be found
recording the insignificant details so dear to the native
poet, such as the boarding netting, or the sickness of
Midshipman Renouard, or better still, the outbreak of the
Great Lila Sickness, the inference may be taken as
proved.</p>

<p>Any other navigator than Edwards would have given
us details of Oliver's wonderful voyage, or, at least, would
have preserved his log, but the voyage from Fiji to the
Great Barrier reef is a blank. Hamilton, indeed, alludes
vaguely to the crew having had to be on their guard "at
other islands that were inhabited," and since their course
from Fiji to Endeavour Straits would have carried them
through the heart of the New Hebrides, and close to
Malicolo, we may assume that they called at Api, at
Ambrym or at Malicolo to replenish their stock of water.
They reached the Great Barrier reef in the greatest distress,
and having run "from shore to shore," <i>i.e.</i> from
New Guinea to within sight of the coast of Queensland
without finding an opening, and having to choose between
the alternatives of shipwreck or of death by famine, they
went boldly at it, and beat over the reef. Even then they
would have starved but for their providential encounter
with a small Dutch vessel cruising a little to the westward
of Endeavour Straits, which supplied them with water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
and provisions. The governor of the first Dutch settlement
they touched at, having a description of the mutineers
from the British Government, and observing that
their schooner was built of foreign timber, refused to
believe their account of themselves, especially as Oliver,
being a petty officer, could produce no commission or
warrant in support of his statement, and imprisoned them
all, without, however, treating them with harshness. On
the first opportunity he sent them to Samarang, where
Edwards had them released. The plucky little schooner
was sold, to begin another career of usefulness as set
forth in the footnote to <a href="#Footnote_33-1">p. 33</a>, and her purchase money
was divided among the <i>Pandora's</i> crew.</p>

<p>Thus ended one of the most eventful voyages in the
history of South Sea discovery, dismissed by Edwards
in a few lines; by Hamilton in two pages. The search
made among the naval archives at the Record Office
leaves but little hope that any log-book or journal has
been preserved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Edwards, disappointed in his search for the
tender at Namuka and Tofoa, and prevented by a head
wind from examining Tongatabu, set his course again for
Samoa, and passed within sight of Vavau by the way.
Making the easterly extremity of the group, he visited in
turn Manua, Tutuila, and Upolu, but, like Bougainville, did
not sight Savaii, which lay a little to the northward of
his course. It is not surprising that the natives of Upolu
denied all knowledge of the tender, seeing that they had
made a determined attempt upon her less than a month
before. From Samoa he sailed to Vavau which he named
Howe's Group, in ignorance that it had been discovered
by Maurelle ten years before, and subsequently visited by
La P&eacute;rouse. Running southward, he made Pylstaart, at
that time inhabited by Tongan castaways, and the fact
that he did not stop to examine it, although he saw by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
smoke that it was inhabited, shows that he had begun to
tire of his search for the mutineers. Having enquired
at Tongatabu and Eua, he returned to Namuka for
water, and at this point any systematic search either
for the tender or the mutineers seems to have been
abandoned.</p>

<p>Edwards had now been nine months at sea, and the prospect
of the long homeward voyage round the Cape was still
before him. With every league he had sailed westward
the scent had grown fainter, and he was about to pass
the spot from which the mutineers were known to have
sailed in the opposite direction. His course is not easy
to explain. To reason that the tender had fallen to leeward
of her rendezvous, and had been compelled to seek
shelter and provisions at one of the islands discovered by
Bligh only two days' sail to the westward, required no high
degree of foresight; and yet Edwards, who must have
known the position of the Fiji islands from Bligh's narrative,
deliberately set his course for Niuatobutabu, two
days' sail to the north-west. But, falling to leeward of it,
he made Niuafo'ou, the curious volcanic island discovered
by Schouten in 1616, and never since visited. The prevailing
wind making a visit to Niuatobutabu now impossible,
he visited Wallis Island, and then bore away to
the west.</p>

<p>On August 8th, 1791, he made the discovery of Rotuma,
whose enterprising people now furnish the Torres Straits
pearl fishery with its best divers. It is difficult to forgive
him for leaving so meagre an account of this interesting
little community of mixed Polynesian and Micronesian
blood. Edwards was probably mistaken in thinking their
intentions hostile. Kau Moala, a Tongan who visited
them in 1807, and related his experiences to Mariner,
describes them as always friendly to strangers. Probably
they took the <i>Pandora</i> for a god-ship, and since the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
Immortals of their Pantheon are generally malevolent, they
left their women behind, and flourished weapons to scare
the gods into good behaviour. In 1807 they had forgotten
the visit, perhaps because it had brought them no calamity
to inspire the native poets. Hamilton relates an incident
quite in keeping with the character of this determined and
sturdy little people. "One fellow was making off with
some booty, but was detected; and although five of the
stoutest men in the ship were hanging upon him, and had
fast hold of his long flowing black hair, he overpowered
them all, and jumped overboard with his prize."</p>

<p>The ill fortune that pursued Edwards, that had baulked
him of Pitcairn when it lay within a few hours' sail, that
had cheated him at once of the recovery of his tender and
the discovery of Fiji, and was soon to rob him of his ship,
now dealt him the unkindest cut of all. On August 13th,
he sighted the island of Vanikoro, and ran along its shore,
sometimes within a mile of the reef. There was no conceivable
reason why he should not have made some attempt
to communicate with the inhabitants whose smoke signals
attracted his attention. Had he done so, he would have
been the means of rescuing the survivors of La P&eacute;rouse's
expedition, and of clearing away the mystery that covered
their fate for so many years. For, after Dillon's discoveries,
there can be little doubt that they were on the
island at that very time, and it is not unlikely that the
smoke was actually a signal made by them to attract his
attention. The Comte de la P&eacute;rouse, who had been
despatched on a voyage of discovery by Louis XVI. on
the eve of the Revolution, handed his journals to Governor
Phillip in Botany Bay for transmission to Europe in 1788,
and neither he, nor his two frigates, nor any of their
company were ever seen again. Their fate produced so
painful an impression in France that the National Assembly,
then in the throes of the Revolution, sent out a relief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
expedition under "Citizen-admiral" d'Entrecasteaux, and
issued a splendid edition of his journals at the public
expense. We now know from the native account elicited
by Dillon that during a hurricane on a very dark night
both frigates struck on the reef of Vanikoro, that the
<i>Astrolabe</i> foundered with all hands in deep water, and the
crew of the <i>Boussole</i> got safe to land. They stayed on the
island until they had built a brig of native timber, in
which they sailed away to the westward to meet a second
shipwreck, perhaps on the Great Barrier reef. But two
of them stayed behind for many years, and of these one
was certainly alive in 1825. Now, Edwards saw Vanikoro
just three years after the wreck, and even if the brig had
sailed, there were two castaways who could have cleared
up the mystery.</p>

<p>After a narrow escape from shipwreck on the Indispensable
Reef, he made the coast of New Guinea, supposing
it to be one of the Louisiades. And here has occurred one
of those curious errors in geographical nomenclature which
are perpetuated by the most permanent of all histories&mdash;the
Admiralty charts. Edwards gives the positions of two
conspicuous headlands, which he named Cape Rodney and
Cape Hood, and of a mountain lying between them which
he called Mount Clarence. All these names appear in the
Admiralty charts, but they are assigned to the wrong
places. To a ship coming from the eastward the Cape
Rodney of the charts is not conspicuous enough to have
attracted Edwards' attention. The Cape Hood of the
charts, on the contrary, cannot be mistaken, and it lies
exactly in the position which Edwards gave for Cape
Rodney. The "Cape Hood" that Edwards saw was
undoubtedly Round Head, and his Mount Clarence must
have been the high cone between them in the Saroa district.
The <i>Pandora</i> must have approached on one of those
misty mornings when the clouds creep down the mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
sides of New Guinea, and obscure the ranges that rise,
tier upon tier, right up to the towering peak of Mount
Victoria, or Edwards could not have mistaken the continent
for the insignificant islands of the Louisiades. On
such a morning a narrow line of coast stands out clear
against a background of sombre fog.</p>

<p>The baleful fortune of the <i>Pandora</i>, now folded her
wings and perched upon the taffrail. By hugging the
coast of New Guinea she would have won a clear passage
through these wreck-strewn straits of Torres, but the
navigators of those days counted on clear water to
Endeavour Straits, and recked little of the dangers of the
Great Barrier reef. Bligh, who chanced upon a passage
in 12.34 S. Lat. so aptly that he called it "Providential
Channel," cautioned future navigators in words that
should have warned Edwards against the course he was
steering. "These, however, are marks too small for a
ship to hit, unless it can hereafter be ascertained that
passages through the reef are numerous along the coast."
Edwards was not looking for Bligh's passage, which lay
more than two degrees southward of his course. He
had lately adopted a most dangerous practice of running
blindly on through the night. Until he made the coast of
New Guinea, he had profited by the warning of Bougainville,
the only navigator whose book he seems to have
studied, and always lay to till daylight, but now, in the
most dangerous sea in the world, he threw this obvious
precaution to the wind. Hamilton, to whom we are
indebted for this information (for it did not transpire at
the court martial) says that "the great length of the
voyage would not permit it." How fatuous a proceeding
it was in unsurveyed and unknown waters may be judged
from the fact that in coral seas that have been carefully
surveyed all ships of war are now compelled to keep the
lead going whenever they move in coral waters. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
August 25th he discovered the Murray Islands, and, after
spending the day in a vain attempt to force a passage
through them, he followed the reef southward for two
days without finding a passage. This must have brought
him very near the latitude of Bligh's passage. On the
morning of August 28th Lieut. Corner was sent to examine
what appeared to be a channel, and an hour before dark
he signalled that he had found a passage large enough for
the ship. The night fell before the boat could get back,
and this induced Edwards, who had already lost one boat's
crew and his tender, to lie much closer to the reef than was
prudent. The current did the rest. About seven the
ship struck heavily, and, bumping over the reef, tore her
planking so that, despite eleven hours incessant pumping,
she foundered shortly after daylight. Eighty-nine of the
ship's company and ten of the mutineers were picked up
by the boats and landed on a sand cay four miles distant,
and thirty-one sailors, and four mutineers (who went
down in manacles) were drowned.</p>

<p>Having read the different versions of this affair both
for and against Edwards, I think it is proved that, besides
treating his prisoners with inhumanity, he disregarded the
orders of the Admiralty. His attitude towards the
prisoners was always consistent. We learn from Corner
that he allowed Coleman, Norman and Mackintosh to
work at the pumps, but that when the others implored
him to let them out of irons he placed two additional
sentries over them, and threatened to shoot the first man
who attempted to liberate himself. Every allowance
must be made for the fear that in the disordered state of
the ship, they might have made an attempt to escape, but
during the eleven hours in which the water was gaining
upon the pumps there was ample time to provide for their
security. That so many were saved was due, not to him,
but to a boatswain's mate, who risked his own life to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
liberate them. Lieut. Corner, who would not have been
likely to err on the side of hostility to Edwards, gives his
evidence against him in this particular. But whether he
is to be believed or not, the fact that four of the prisoners
went down in irons is impossible to extenuate.</p>

<p>Edwards dismisses the boat voyage in very few words,
though, in fact, it was a remarkable achievement to take
four overloaded boats from the Barrier Reef to Timor
without the loss of a single man. He made the coast of
Queensland a little to the south of Albany Island, where
the blacks first helped him to fill his water breakers, and
then attacked him. He watered again at Horn Island,
and then sailed through the passage which bears Flinders'
name owing to the fallacy that he discovered it. After
clearing the sound, he seems to have mistaken Prince of
Wales' Island for Cape York, which he had left many miles
behind him.</p>

<p>Favoured by a fair wind and a calm sea, he made the
run from Flinders passage to Timor in eleven days. Like
Bligh, he found that the young bore their privations better
than the old, and that the first effect of thirst and famine
is to make men excessively irritable. Hamilton records a
characteristic incident. Edwards had neglected to conduct
prayers in his boat until he was reminded of his duty
by one of the mutineers, who was leading the devotions
of the seamen in the bows of the boat. Scandalized at
the impropriety of a "pirate" daring to appeal to the
Highest Tribunal for mercy, as it were, behind the back
of the earthly court before which he was shortly to be
arraigned, the captain sternly reproved him, and conducted
prayers himself. A sense of humour was not
numbered among Edwards' endowments.</p>

<p>Timor was sighted on the 13th September, and on the
15th the party landed at Coupang, where the Dutch
authorities received them with every hospitality. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
they met the survivors of a third boat voyage, scarcely
less adventurous than Bligh's and their own. A party
of convicts, including a woman and two small children,
had contrived to steal a ship's gig and to escape in her
from Port Jackson. Sleeping on shore at nights whenever
possible, subsisting on shell-fish and sea-birds, they ran
the entire length of the Queensland coast, threaded
Endeavour Straits, and arrived at Coupang after an
exposure lasting ten weeks without the loss of a single life.
Having given themselves out as the survivors from the
wreck of an English ship, they were entertained with
great hospitality until the arrival of Edwards two weeks
later, when they betrayed their story gratuitously. The
captain of a Dutch vessel, who spoke English, on first
hearing the news of Edwards' landing, ran to them with
the glad tidings of their captain's arrival, on which one
of them started up in surprise and exclaimed, "What
captain? Dam'me! we have no captain." On hearing
this the governor had them arrested, and sent to the castle,
one man and the woman having to be pursued into the
bush before they were taken. They then confessed that
they were escaped convicts.</p>

<p>Apart from their adventurous voyage, there is much
romance about their story. William Bryant, the leader,
had been transported for smuggling, and his sweetheart,
Mary Broad, who was maid to a lady in Salcombe, in
Devonshire for connivance in her lover's escape from Winchester
Gaol. In due course they were married in Botany
Bay, where Bryant was employed as fisherman to the
governor, a post that enabled him to plan their successful
escape. Bryant and both children died on the voyage
home, together with three others, Morton, Cox and Simms,
but the woman survived to obtain a full pardon, owing
chiefly to the exertions of an officer of marines who went
home with her in the <i>Gorgon</i>, and eventually married<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
her.<a name="FNanchor_24-1" id="FNanchor_24-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_24-1" class="fnanchor">[24-1]</a> Butcher, who was also pardoned, returned to New
South Wales and became a thriving settler. The remaining
four were sent back to complete their sentences. Their
story has been graphically told by Messrs. Louis Becke
and Walter Jeffery in "The First Fleet Family."</p>

<p>During the voyage from Coupang to Batavia Edwards
narrowly escaped a second shipwreck. The <i>Rembang</i> was
dismasted on a lee shore in a cyclone, and, but for the
exertions of the English seamen, would assuredly have
been stranded, the Dutch sailors, who, says the facetious
Hamilton, "would fight the devil should he appear to
them in any other shape but that of thunder and lightning,"
having taken to their hammocks. At Samarang,
as already related, Edwards found the tender, which he
had long given up for lost, and the price she fetched
enabled the crew to purchase decent clothing. Heywood
afterwards asserted that no clothing was given to the
prisoners but what they could earn by plaiting and selling
straw hats. They were miserably housed, when on board
the <i>Rembang</i>, and kept in rigid confinement both at
Batavia, and on the <i>Vreedemberg</i>, in which they made the
voyage to the Cape.</p>

<p>At Batavia Edwards divided his men among three
Dutch vessels homeward bound, but at the Cape he
removed his own contingent into H.M.S. <i>Gorgon</i>, and
arrived at Spithead on June 18th, 1792. Two days later
the ten mutineers were transferred to H.M.S. <i>Hector</i>,
Captain Montague, and the convicts were sent to Newgate.
The court martial, which did not assemble until
September 12th, lasted five days, with the result that
Norman, Coleman, Mackintosh and Byrne were acquitted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
and Heywood, Morrison, Ellison, Burkitt, Millward and
Muspratt were condemned to death, the two first being
recommended to mercy. On October 24th Heywood and
Morrison received the King's pardon, and both re-entered
the Navy, Heywood to retire in 1816, when nearly at the
head of the list of captains; Morrison to go down in the
ill-fated <i>Blenheim</i> in which he was serving as gunner.
Muspratt also was pardoned, but the three others were
hanged on board the <i>Brunswick</i> in Portsmouth Harbour
on October 29th, 1792. Thus ended a voyage that, for
adventure and discovery, deserves a high place in the
history of maritime enterprise in the Pacific. Voyages
take their rank from the scientific attainments and literary
ability of the men who record them, and the <i>Pandora</i>,
unlucky in her fate as in her ill-omened name, was scarcely
less unfortunate in her historian.</p>

Unfortunately the journal says very little of the <i>Gorgon's</i> voyage
home.</p></div>

<p>Be pleased to acquaint My Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty that I sailed again from Jack-in-the-Basket
with His Majesty's Ship <i>Pandora</i> under my
command on the 7th day of November, and anchored in
Santa Cruz by Teneriffe on the 22nd: that nothing particular
occured in my passage to this place, except that
of my falling in with His Majesty's sloop <i>Shark</i> on the
17th November in Latitude 32&deg; 33&#8242; Longitude 13&deg; 40&#8242; W.
bound to Madeira with despatches for Rear Admiral
Cornish, and my learning from them that the matters in
dispute with Spain were amicably settled, of which circumstance
I was unacquainted when I left England. I
am now compleating my water, and have taken on board
full 3 months wine for my compliment, with some fruit
and vegetables, and purpose and flatter myself that I
shall be able to sail from hence this evening. Inclosed I
send the state and condition of His Majesty's Ship
<i>Pandora</i> for their Lordships' information, and I have the
honour to be,</p>

the 6th January, 1791.</p>

<p class="center">[Received 29th June and read.]</p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Be pleased to acquaint My Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty that I sailed from Teneriff with His
Majesty's Ship <i>Pandora</i> on the afternoon of the 25th
November, agreeable to my intentions signified to their
Lordships by letter from that island, and anchored off the
city Rio Janeiro on the evening of the 31st of December
with a view to compleat my water and to get refreshments
for the ship's company and from my being persuaded
that very long runs, particularly with new ships' companies,
are prejudicial to health, and as my men are of
that description, and have also suffered in their health
from a fever which has prevailed amongst them in a
greater or less degree ever since they left England, were
other inducements for my touching at this port. I shall
stay here no longer than is absolutely necessary to procure
these articles, and which I expect to be able to accomplish
by the seventh of this month, and I shall then
proceed on my voyage as soon as wind and weather will
permit.</p>

<p>Herewith I send the state and condition of His Majesty's
Ship <i>Pandora</i>, and I have the honour to be, Sir,</p>

<p class="center">Your most obedient and humble servant,</p>

<p class="center">29th May, 1792.</p>
<p class="right">From Amsterdam.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>In a letter dated the 6th day of January, 1791,
which I did myself the honour to address to you from Rio
Janeiro I gave an account of my proceedings up to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
time and inclosed the state and condition of His Majesty's
Ship <i>Pandora</i> under my command, and having compleated
the water and procured such articles of provision, etc.,
for the use of the Ship's Company as they were in want of
and I thought necessary for the voyage, I sailed from that
port on the 8th January, 1791, run along the coast of
America, Tierra Del Fuego, Hatin Land, round Cape
Horn and proceeded directly to Otaheite, and arrived at
Matavy Bay in that Island on the 23rd March without
having touched in any other place in my passage thither.</p>

<p>It was my intention to have put into New Year's harbour,
or some other port in its neighbourhood to complete
our water and to refresh my people, could I have effected
that business within the month of January; but as I
arrived too late on that coast to fulfil my intentions within
the time, it determined me to push forward without delay,
by which means I flattered myself I might avoid that
extreme bad weather and all the evil consequences that
are usually experienced in doubling Cape Horn in a more
advanced season of the year, and I had the good fortune
not to be disappointed in my expectation.</p>

<p>After doubling the Cape, and advancing Northward
into warmer weather, the fever which had prevailed on
board gradually declined, and the diseases usually succeeding
such fevers prevented by a liberal use of the
antiscorbutics and other nourishing and useful articles
with which we were so amply supplied, and the ship's
company arrived at Otaheite in perfect health, except a
few whose debilitated constitutions no climate, provisions
or medicine could much improve.</p>

<p>In our run to Otaheite we discovered 3 islands: the
first, which I called Ducie's Island, lies in Latitude
24&deg; 40&#8242; 30&#8243; S. and Longitude 124&deg; 36&#8242; 30&#8243; W. from
Greenwich. It is between 2 and 3 miles long. The
second I called Lord Hood's Island. It lies in Latitude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
21&deg; 31&#8242; S. and Longitude 135&deg; 32&#8242; 30&#8243; W., and is about 8
miles long. The third I called Carysfort's Island. It lies
in Latitude 20&deg; 49&#8242; S. and Longitude 138&deg; 33&#8242; W. and it
is 5 miles long. They are all three low lagoon islands
covered with wood, but we saw no inhabitants on either
of them.<a name="FNanchor_30-1" id="FNanchor_30-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_30-1" class="fnanchor">[30-1]</a> Before we anchored at Matavy Bay, Joseph
Coleman, Armourer of the <i>Bounty</i>, and several of the
natives came on board, from whom I learned that Christian
the pirate had landed and left 16 of his men on the
Island, some of whom were then at Matavy, and some had
sailed from there the morning before our arrival (in a
schooner they had built) for Papara, a distant part of the
Island, to join other of the pirates that were settled at that
place, and that Churchill, Master at Arms, had been
murdered by Matthew Thompson, and that Matthew
Thompson was killed by the natives and offered as a
sacrifice on their altars for the murder of Churchill, whom
they had made a chief.</p>

<p>George Stewart and Peter Heywood, midshipmen of the
<i>Bounty</i>, came on board the <i>Pandora</i> soon after she came
to an anchor, and I had also information that Richard
Skinner was at Matavy. I desired Poen, an inferior chief
(who, in the absence of Otoo, was the principal person in
the district) to bring him on board. The chief went on
shore for the purpose, and soon after he returned again
and informed me that Skinner was coming on board.
Before night he did come on board, but whether it was in
consequence of the chief's instructions, or his own accord,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
I am at a loss to say. As soon as the ship was moored
the pinnace and launch were got ready and sent under
the direction of Lt. Corner and Hayward in pursuit of the
pirates and schooner in hopes of getting hold of them
before they could get information of our arrival, and
Odiddee, a native of Bolabola, and who has been with
Capt. Cook, etc., went with them as a guide.</p>

<p>The boats were discovered by the pirates before they
had arrived at the place where these people had landed,
and they immediately embarked in their schooner and put
to sea, and she was chased the remainder of the day by our
boats, but, it blowing fresh, she outsailed them, and the
boats returned to the ship. Jno. Brown, the person left
at Otaheite by Mr. Cox of the <i>Mercury</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31-1" id="FNanchor_31-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_31-1" class="fnanchor">[31-1]</a> and from whom
their Lordships supposed I might get some useful information,
had been under the necessity for his own safety to
associate with the pirates, but he took the opportunity
to leave them when they were about to embark in the
schooner and put to sea. He informed me that they had
very little water and provisions on board, or vessels to
hold them in, and, of course, could not keep at sea long.
I entered Brown on the ship's books as part of the compliment
and found him very intelligent and useful in the
different capacities of guide, soldier and seaman. I
employed different people to look out for and to give
information on their landing either on this or the neighbouring
islands.</p>

<p>On the 26th, in the evening, sent the pinnace to Edee
by desire of the old Otoo, or king, to bring him on board
the <i>Pandora</i>. Early on the morning of the 27th, I had
information that the pirates were returning with the
schooner to Papara and that they were landed and retired
to the mountains, to endeavour to conceal and defend
themselves. Immediately sent Lt. Corner with 26 men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
in the launch to Papara to pursue them. At night
the Otoo, his two queens and suite came on board the
pinnace and slept on board the <i>Pandora</i>, which they
afterwards frequently did.</p>

<p>The next morning Lt. Hayward was sent with a
party in the pinnace to join the party in the launch at
Papara. I found the Otoo ready to furnish me with guides
and to give me any other assistance in his power, but he
had very little authority or influence in that part of the
island where the pirates had taken refuge, and even his
right to the sovereignty of the eastern part of the island
had been recently disputed by Tamarie, one of the royal
family. Under these circumstances I conceived the taking
of the Otoo and the other chiefs attached to his interest
into custody would alarm the faithful part of his subjects
and operate to our disadvantage. I therefore satisfied
myself with the assistance he offered and had in his power
to give me, and I found means at different times to send
presents to Tamarie (and invited him to come on board,
which he promised to do, but never fulfilled his promise),
and convinced him I had it in my power to lay his country
in waste, which I imagined would be sufficient at least to
make him withhold that support he hitherto, through
policy, had occasionally given to the pirates in order to
draw them to his interest and to strengthen his own party
against the Otoo.</p>

<p>I probably might have had it in my power to have taken
and secured the person of Tamarie, but I was apprehensive
that such an attempt might irritate the natives attached
to his interest, and induce them to act hostilely against
our party at a time the ship was at too great a distance
to afford them timely and necessary assistance in case of
such an event, and I adopted the milder method for that
reason, and from a persuasion that our business could be
brought to a conclusion at less risk and in less time by that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
means. The yawl was sent to Papara with spare hands to
bring back the launch which was wanted to water the
ship, and on the 29th the launch returned to the ship with
James Morrison,<a name="FNanchor_33-1" id="FNanchor_33-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_33-1" class="fnanchor">[33-1]</a> Charles Norman, and Thomas Ellison,
belonging to the <i>Bounty</i>, and who had been made prisoners
at Papara on the 7th April. The companies returned with
the detachment from Papara, and brought with them the
pirate schooner which they had taken there. The natives
had deserted the place, and I had information that the
six remaining pirates had fled to the mountains.</p>

<p>On the 5th I sent Lt. Hayward with 25 men in
the schooner and yawl to Papara, the old Otoo and
several of the youths, &amp;c., went with him. On the 7th, in
the morning, Lt. Corner was landed with 16 men at
Point Venus in order to march round the back of the
mountains, in which the pirates had retreated, to cooperate
with the party sent to Papara. Orissia, the Otoo's
brother, and a party of natives went with him as guides
and to carry the provisions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the 9th Lt. Hayward returned with the schooner
and yawl and brought with him Henry Hillbrant, Thomas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
M'Intosh, Thomas Burkitt, Jno. Millward, Jno. Sumner
and William Muspratt, the six remaining pirates belonging
to the <i>Bounty</i>. They had quitted the mountains and had
got down near the seashore when they were discovered
by our party on the opposite side of a river. They submitted,
on being summoned to lay down their arms. Lt.
Corner with his party marched across the mountains to
Papara, and a boat was sent for them there, and they
returned on board again on the 13th in the afternoon. I
put the pirates in the round house which I built at the
after part of the Quarter deck for their more effectual
security, airy and healthy situation, and to separate them
from, and to prevent their having any communication
with, or to crowd and incommode the ship's company.</p>

<p>Contrary to my expectations, the water we got at the
usual place at Point Venus turned out very bad, and on
touching for better, most excellent water was found issuing
out of a rock in a little bay to the southward of One Tree
Hill. I mention this circumstance because it may be of
importance to be known to other ships that may hereafter
touch at that island.</p>

<p>The natives had in their possession a bower anchor
belonging to the <i>Bounty</i>, which that ship had left in the
bay, and I took it on board the <i>Pandora</i>, and made them
a handsome present by way of salvage and as a reward for
their ingenuity in weighing it with materials so ill calculated
for the purpose. I learned from different people
and from journals kept on board the <i>Bounty</i>, which were
found in the chests of the pirates at Otaheite, that after
Lt. Bligh and the people with him were turned adrift
in the launch, the pirates proceeded with the ship to the
Island of Toobouai in Latitude 20&deg; 13&#8242; S. and Longitude
149&deg; 35&#8242; W., where they anchored on the 25th May, 1789.
Before their arrival there they threw the greatest part of
the bread fruit plants overboard, and the property of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
officers and people that were turned out of the ship was
divided amongst those who remained on board her, and
the royals and some other small sails were cut up and
disposed of in the same manner.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding they met with some opposition from
the natives, they intended to settle on this island, but
after some time they perceived that they were in want of
several things necessary for a settlement and which was
the cause of disagreements and quarrels amongst themselves.
At last they came to a resolution to come to
Otaheite to get such of the things wanted as could be
procured there, and in consequence of that resolution they
sailed from Toobouai at the latter end of the month and
arrived at Otaheite on the 6th of June. The Otoo and
other natives were very inquisitive and desirous to know
what was become of Lt. Bligh and the other absentees
and the bread fruit plants, &amp;c. They deceived them by
saying that they had fallen in with Captain Cook at an
island he had lately discovered called "Why-Too-Tackee"
[Aitutaki], and where he intended to settle, and that
the plants were landed and planted there, and that Lt.
Bligh and the other absentees were detained to assist
Captain Cook in the business he had in hand, and that he
had appointed Christian captain of the <i>Bounty</i> and ordered
him to Otaheite for an additional supply of hogs, goats,
fowls, bread fruit plants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These humane islanders were imposed upon by this
artful story, and they were so rejoiced to hear that their
old friend Captain Cook was alive and was near them that
they used every means in their power to procure the
things that were wanted, so that in the course of a few
days the <i>Bounty</i> took on board 312 hogs, 38 goats,
eight dozen fowls, a bull and a cow, and a quantity of
bread fruit plants, &amp;c. They also took with them a
woman, eight men and seven boys. With these supplies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
they sailed from Otaheite on the 19th June and arrived
again at Toobouai on the 26th. They landed the live
stock on the quays that were near the harbour, lightened
the ship and warped her up the harbour into two fathoms
water opposite to the place where they intended to build
the fort. On this occasion their spare masts, yards and
booms were got out and moored, but they afterwards
broke adrift and were lost.<a name="FNanchor_36-1" id="FNanchor_36-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_36-1" class="fnanchor">[36-1]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th July they began to build the fort. Its
dimensions were 50 yards square. These villains had
frequent quarrels amongst themselves which at last were
carried to such a length that no order was observed
amongst them, and by the 30th August the work at the
fort was discontinued. They had also almost continual
disputes and skirmishes with the natives, which were
generally brought on by their own violence and depredations.
Christian, perceiving that he had lost his authority,
and that nothing more could be done, desired them to
consult together and consider what step would be the
most advisable to take, and said that he would put into
execution the opinion that was supported by the most
votes. After long consultation it was at last determined
that the scheme of staying at Toobouai should be given
up, and that the ship should be taken to Otaheite, where
those who chose to go on shore should be at liberty to do
so, and those who remained on the ship might take her
away to whatever place they should think fit.</p>

<p>In consequence of this final determination preparations
were made for the purpose and they sailed from Toobouai
on the 15th and arrived at Matavy Bay, Otaheite, on the
20th September 1789. The bull which they took from
Otaheite died on its passage to Toobouai, and they killed
the cow before they left that island, yet, notwithstanding
this and the depredations they committed there, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
natives still derived considerable advantage from their
visits, as several hogs, goats, fowls and other things of
their introduction were left behind. These sixteen men
mentioned before were landed at Otaheite, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>These fourteen were made prisoners by my people and
Charles Churchill and Matthew Thompson were murdered
on that island. Previous to these people being put on
shore the small arms, powder, canvas and the small stores
belonging to the ship were equally divided amongst the
whole crew. After building the schooner six of these
people actually sailed in her for the East Indies, but
meeting with bad weather and suspecting the abilities of
Morrison, whom they had chosen to be their captain to
navigate her there, they returned again to Otaheite on the
night between the 21st and 22nd of September 1789 and
were seen in the morning to the N.W. of Point Venus.<a name="FNanchor_37-5" id="FNanchor_37-5"></a><a href="#Footnote_37-5" class="fnanchor">[37-5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>Fletcher Christian, Edward Young, Matthew Quintall,
William M'Koy, Alexander Smith, John Williams, Isaac
Martin, William Brown and John Mills went away in the
ship and they also took with them several natives of these
islands, both men and women, but I could not exactly
learn their numbers, only that they had on board a few
more women than white men, a deficiency of whom had
formerly been one of their grievances and the principal
cause of their quarrels. Christian had been frequently
heard to declare that he would search for an unknown or
uninhabited island in which there was no harbour for shipping,
would run the ship ashore and get from her such
things as would be useful to him and settle there, but this
information was too vague to be followed in an immense
ocean strewed with an almost innumerable number of
known and unknown islands; therefore after the ship was
caulked, which I found was necessary to be done, the
rigging overhauled and in other respects refitted her for
sea, and fitted the pirates' schooner as a tender, and put on
board two petty officers<a name="FNanchor_38-1" id="FNanchor_38-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_38-1" class="fnanchor">[38-1]</a> and seven men to navigate her,
conceiving she would be of considerable use in covering
the boats in my future search for the <i>Bounty</i>, as well as
for reconnoitring the passage through the reef leading to
Endeavour Straits; I sailed from Otaheite on the 8th of
May with a view to put the remainder of my orders into
execution.</p>

<p>Oediddee was desirous to go in the <i>Pandora</i> to Ulietia
and to Bolabola, and as I thought he would be useful as
a guide for the boats I took him with me and steered for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
Huahaine which we saw the next morning. The tender
and the boats were employed the 9th and part of the 10th
in examining the harbours, and Oediddee went with them
as pilot. Several chiefs came on board and brought with
them hogs and other articles, the produce of the island,
and a servant of Omai also came on board, and said that
he was not then much the better for his master's riches,
however his former connections was the cause of his visit
to the ship being made very profitable to him, and all the
chiefs and their attendances received presents from me.
Two of the chiefs of this island were desirous to go in the
ship to Ulietia and I had given them leave to, but when the
ship was about to make sail they suddenly changed their
minds and went on shore and took Oediddee with them.
Oediddee promised to follow us there the next day, but
we did not see him again.</p>

<p>I proceeded to Ulietea Otaka and Bolabola, and the
tender and boats were employed in examining the bays
and harbours of these islands, but we got no intelligence
of the <i>Bounty</i> or her people. Tahatoo, who called himself
king of Bolabola, informed me that he had been a few
days before at Tubai, which is a small, low island situated
on the Northward of Bolabola and under its jurisdiction,
and that there were no white men upon that island, nor
upon Maurua, another island in sight of it and to the
westward of Bolabola. He also mentioned another island
which I thought he called Mojeshah, but we know no such
island unless it be Howe's Island, and that seems to be
situated too far to the South and to the West for the island
he attempted to describe and point out to us. The chiefs
and several other people came on board from these islands
and brought with them the usual produce, and they were
at all the isles very pressing to prevail upon us to make a
longer stay with them, but as I had no object particularly
in view and my people in good health, I did not think it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
proper unnecessarily to waste my time for the sake of
procuring a few articles that were in greater abundance
in these islands than at Otaheite. I made presents to all
those chiefs as it was my custom to do to everyone that
had the least pretension to pre-eminence, and to all the
people who came on board in the first boat.</p>

<p>After leaving Bolabola I steered for Maurua and passed
it at a small distance. Howe's Island was not seen by us
as it is a low island and we passed to the Southward of it.
I then shaped my course to get into the latitude of and to
fall in to the Eastward of Why-to-tackee [Aitutaki].</p>

<p>On the 14th, Henry Hillbrant, one of the pirates, gave
information that Christian had declared to him the evening
before he left Otaheite that he intended to go with the
<i>Bounty</i> to an uninhabited island discovered by Mr. Byron,
situated to the Westward of the Isles of Danger, which,
from description of the situation, I found to be the island
called by Mr. Byron "The Duke of York's Island,"<a name="FNanchor_40-1" id="FNanchor_40-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_40-1" class="fnanchor">[40-1]</a> and
if they could land, would settle there and run the ship
upon the reef and destroy her, and if they could not land,
or if on examination found it would not answer their
purpose, he would look out for some other uninhabited
island. However, I continued my course for Why-to-tackee,
being now determined to examine the island in
preference to following any intelligence, however plausible,
and on the morning of the 19th saw the Island of Why-to-tackee
[Aitutaki],<a name="FNanchor_40-2" id="FNanchor_40-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_40-2" class="fnanchor">[40-2]</a> and sent the tender in shore to ground
and look out for a harbour.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
At noon sent Lt. Hayward in the yawl to look into a
place on the N.W. part of the island that had the appearance
of a harbour and to get intelligence of the natives.
In the evening he returned. The place was so far from
being fit for the reception of the ship that he could scarcely
find a passage through the reef for the boat; he conversed
with seven or eight different sets of people, whom he met
with in canoes, and they all agreed that the <i>Bounty</i> was
not, nor had not been there since Lt. Bligh left the
island, nor did any of them known anything of her. Lt.
Hayward recollected one of the natives, whom he remembered
to have seen on board the <i>Bounty</i> when he discovered
the island, and he saw another savage belonging to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
a neighbouring island who knew Captain Cook and
inquired after him, Omai and Oediddee, whom he said he
had seen.</p>

<p>These people at first approached the boat with caution,
and could not be prevailed upon to come on board the
ship. As I was convinced that the <i>Bounty</i> was not on this
island, and as Hervey's, Mangea and Wattea Islands to
the S.E. of Why-to-tackee were inhabited, I did not think
it probable that Christian, in the weak state the ship was
in, would attempt to settle upon either of them, and as
there was some plausibility in the information given me
by Hillbrant the prisoner, and as the Duke of York's
Island seemed to answer the description of such an island
as Christian had been heard by others to declare he would
search for to settle on, it being by Mr. Byron's account
uninhabited, and with a harbour; and as the fact that
it was out of the known track of ships in these seas since
our acquaintance with the Society Islands, made it still
more eligible for his purpose; from these united circumstances
I thought it was probable he might make choice
of the Duke of York's Island for his intended settlement.
I therefore determined to proceed to that island, taking
Palmerston's island in my way thither, as it also answered
in all respects, except situation, to the description of the
other; and at night I bore away and made sail for
Palmerston's Island, and made that on the 21st in the
afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_42-1" id="FNanchor_42-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_42-1" class="fnanchor">[42-1]</a></p>

<p>On the 22nd in the morning sent the schooner tender
and cutter in shore to look for the harbours or anchorage,
and soon after Lt. Corner was sent in the yawl for the
same purpose and to look out for the <i>Bounty</i> and her
people. At noon, perceiving the schooner and cutter
had got round the Northernmost island, I stood round the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
S.E. island with the ship in order to join the yawl that was
at a grapnel off that island, and sent the other yawl to
join Lt. Corner. At 4 the two yawls returned with a
quantity of cocoanuts and Lt. Corner also returned on
board. Soon after, Lt. Hayward was sent on shore in
the yawl to examine the S.W. island. After dark we burnt
several false fires as signals to the boat, but the weather
being thick and squally she did not return till the morning
of the 23rd, but the tender joined us that night and informed
me that she had found a yard on the island marked
"Bounty's Driver Yard" and other circumstances that
indicated that the <i>Bounty</i> was, or had been there. The
tender was immediately sent on shore after the yawl.</p>

<p>On the 23rd provisions, ammunition, &amp;c., was sent on
board the tender,<a name="FNanchor_43-1" id="FNanchor_43-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_43-1" class="fnanchor">[43-1]</a> and Lt. Corner with a party of men
were sent with the yawl and tender to land on the
Northernmost island. At 4 in the afternoon, perceiving
that the schooner tender had anchored under that island
the yawl landing the party on the reef leading to it, Lt.
Corner had orders to examine that and the Easternmost
island very minutely to see if any other traces besides the
yard could be made out of the <i>Bounty</i> or her people.</p>

<p>On the 24th in the morning sent the cutter on board the
tender for intelligence, but she did not return till nearly
2 o'clock in the afternoon, when she brought with her
seven men of Lt. Corner's party. She was sent on
board the tender again with orders for the remainder of
the party that was returned from the search to be brought
on board the <i>Pandora</i> in the yawl, and for the cutter to
remain on board the tender to embark Lt. Corner when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
he returned, the midshipman having represented that she
answered the purpose of landing and embarking better
than the larger boat from the particular circumstances of
the landing place; and I stood over for the S.W. island
to take on board the other yawl which had been sent to
ground near the reef of that island and to procure from it
some cocoanuts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At 5 the yawl came on board, and I then stood towards
the schooner in order to take the other yawl on board,
but the weather became squally with rain and I stood out
to sea. During the night the weather was rougher than
usual, with an ugly sea and I did not get close in with
them again till the 28th at noon, soon after which the
yawl came on board from the schooner and informed us to
my great astonishment and concern that the cutter had
not been on board her since she left the ship.<a name="FNanchor_44-1" id="FNanchor_44-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_44-1" class="fnanchor">[44-1]</a> The tender
was ordered to run down by the side of the reef and if
the cutter was not seen there to run out to sea six leagues
and to steer about W.N.W.-W., it being the opposite
point to that on which the wind blew from the preceding
night, and I waited with the ship to take on board Lt.
Corner who was not then returned from the search. He
soon after appeared and was taken on board.</p>

<p>In his search he found a double canoe curiously painted,
and different in make from those we had seen on the islands
we had visited. A piece of wood burnt half through was
also found. The yard and these things lay upon the beach
at high water mark and were all eaten by the sea worm,
which is a strong presumption they were drifted there by
the waves. The driver yard was probably drove from
Toobouai where the <i>Bounty</i> lost the greater part of her
spars, and as no recent traces could be found on the island
of a human being or any part of the wreck of a ship I
gave up all further search and hopes of finding the <i>Bounty</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
or her people there. I then stood out to sea and the ship
and the tender cruized about in search of the cutter until
the 29th in the morning, when seeing nothing of her, I
being at that time well in with the land, sent on shore once
more to examine the reef and beach of the northernmost
island, but with no better success than before, as neither
the cutter or any article belonging to her could be found
there.</p>

<p>I then steered for the Duke of York's island which we
got sight of at noon on the 6th June, and in the afternoon
the tender and two yawls were sent on shore to examine
the coast. On the 7th in the morning Lt. Corner and
Hayward were sent on shore with a party of men attended
by the schooner and two yawls. We soon after saw some
huts upon the island and so made a signal to the boats
to warn them of danger, and for them to be upon their
guard against surprise. They landed and got canoes
to the within side of the lagoon in which they made a
circuit of it. A few houses were found in examining the
hills on the opposite side of the lagoon, and also a ship's
large wooden buoy, which appeared to be of foreign make,
and had evident marks of its having been long in the
water.</p>

<p>As Mr. Byron describes the Duke of York's island to
be without inhabitants, the sight of the houses and ship's
buoy, before they were minutely examined wrot so
strongly on the minds of the people that they saw many
things in imagination that did not exist, but all tended
to persuade them that the <i>Bounty's</i> people were really
upon the island agreeable to the intelligence given by
Hillbrant, but after a most minute and repeated search,
no human being of any description could be found upon
the island. There were a number of canoes, spare
paddles, fishing gear, and a variety of other things found
in the houses which seemed to prove that it was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
occasional residence and fishery of the natives of some
neighbouring islands.<a name="FNanchor_46-1" id="FNanchor_46-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_46-1" class="fnanchor">[46-1]</a></p>

<p>There is so great a difference in the situation of this
island as laid down in the charts of Hawkesworth's
collection of voyages and also some others from that of
Captain Cook that there may be some doubt about its
real situation. I followed that of Captain Cook, yet the
situation of this island by our account did not exactly
agree with him. He lays it down in Latitude 8&deg; 41&#8242; S.
and Longitude 173&deg; 3&#8242; W., and the centre of the island
by our account lies Latitude 8&deg; 34&#8242; S. and Longitude by
observation 172&deg; 6&#8242;, and by timekeeper 172&deg; 39&#8242; W. By
our estimation this island is not so large as it is by Mr.
Byron's. In other respects, except the houses, it answers
his description very well. I should have stood off to the
westward to have seen if there were any other islands in
that direction, but I was apprehensive by so doing
that I might have much difficulty in fetching the island
I had then to visit, and as the wind was favourable
to stand to the Southward when I left the island, I therefore
satisfied myself in passing to the westward of it and
stretching to the northward so far as to know there was
no island within thirty miles of it on that point of the
compass, and also to pass to the windward of the island
when I put about and stood to the northward.</p>

<p>In standing to the Northward I discovered an island
on the 12th June.<a name="FNanchor_46-2" id="FNanchor_46-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_46-2" class="fnanchor">[46-2]</a> We soon perceived that it was a
lagoon island, formed by a great many small islands
connected together by a reef of rocks, forming a circle
round the lagoon in its centre. It is low, but well wooded,
amongst which the cocoanut tree is conspicuous both for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
its height and peculiar form. As we approached the
land we saw several natives on the beach. Lt. Hayward
was sent with the tender and yawl in shore to reconnoitre
and to endeavour to converse with the natives,
and if possible to bring about a friendly intercourse
with them. They made signs of friendship and beckoned
him to come on shore, yet, whenever he drew near with
the boat, they always retired, and he could not prevail
on them to come to her; and the surf was thought too
great to venture to land, at least before the friendship
of the natives was better confirmed.</p>

<p>We soon afterwards saw several sailing canoes with
stages in their middle, sailing across the lagoon for the
opposite islands, but whether it was a flight, or that they
were only going a-fishing, or on some other business,
we were at that time at a loss to know. Lt. Corner was
sent to look for a better landing place, and, thinking that
there was the appearance of an opening into the lagoon
round the N.W. island, I stood that way with the ship
to take a view of it but found that it was also barred in
that part by a reef. Better landing places were found,
but they were to leeward and at a considerable distance
from the place that seemed to be the principal residence
of the natives.</p>

<p>The next morning Lt. Corner and Hayward landed
with a strong party near the houses, which they found
deserted by the natives, and they had taken with them
all the canoes except one. It appeared exactly to resemble
those we had seen at the Duke of York's island.
The houses, fishing gear and utensils were also similar
to those seen there, which made me suppose that these
were the people who occasionally visited that island,
but this had the appearance of being the principal residence
as Morais, or burying places, were found at this,
but none at the former.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
I was very desirous to get into communication with these
people, as I thought we might possibly get some useful
information relative to the buoy we had seen at the Duke
of York's island, or about the <i>Bounty</i> had she touched at
either of these islands, or at any others in their neighbourhood.
With that view I left in and about the houses
hatchets, knives, glasses and a variety of things that I
thought would be useful or pleasing to them, and also to
show them that we were disposed to be friendly to them,
and by that means I hoped they would become less shy,
and that our intercourse with them would be brought
about; and I stood round the northernmost island to
visit other parts of the island, and on the 14th in the
morning Lt. Corner was sent on shore with the tender,
yawl and canoe, and he landed to the eastward of the
northernmost island and marched round to the northeast
extremity of the islands: he perceived marks of bare
feet of the natives in different parts, but more particularly
about the cocoanut trees, most of which were stripped
of their fruit, but not a single person or canoe could be
found. He embarked again at that part of the isles
with great difficulty by the assistance of cork jackets
and rope and the canoe. I supposed that the natives
had left the island and I bore away to join the tender
that had been sent to search for a channel into the lagoon
near the northernmost isle; and after joining her I went
once more towards the place we had first examined,
and seeing no natives or any signs of them there I gave up
the search.</p>

<p>On the 15th stood to the southward for Navigators'
islands. I called the island the Duke of Clarence's Island.
It lies in Latitude 9&deg; 9&#8242; 30&#8243; and Longitude 171&deg; 30&#8242; 46&#8243;.<a name="FNanchor_48-1" id="FNanchor_48-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_48-1" class="fnanchor">[48-1]</a>
From the abundance of cocoanut trees both on this and
the Duke of York's island, in the trunks of which holes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
were cut transversely to catch and preserve water, and
as no other water was seen by us we supposed it was the
only means they had of procuring that useful and necessary
article. On the 18th in the forenoon we saw a very high
island and as I supposed it to be a new discovery I called
it Chatham island,<a name="FNanchor_49-1" id="FNanchor_49-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_49-1" class="fnanchor">[49-1]</a> and standing in for it, I perceived a
Bay towards the N.E. end and I made a tack to endeavour
to look into it. Perceiving that I could not accomplish
my intentions before night I bore away and ran along the
shore and sent the tender to reconnoitre, and found,
opposite to a sandy beach where there was an Indian
town, she got 25 fathoms about a quarter of a mile from
the reef, which runs off the place and carries soundings of
sand regularly in to 5 fathoms.</p>

<p>In the morning a boat was sent to ground in an opening
in the reef before the town, in which 3 fathoms of water
was found, and 2&frac12; fathoms within it. This harbour is
situated on the North side near the middle, but rather
nearest to the West end.<a name="FNanchor_49-2" id="FNanchor_49-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_49-2" class="fnanchor">[49-2]</a> We were told that there was a
river there, and another or two between it and the South
end. We then ran round the West to the S.W. end of the
island and in the bay there 25 fathoms of water was found,
the bottom rather foul and bad landing for a ship's
boat. The natives said there was another, but the boat
being called on board by signal she did not dare to examine
into the truth of their report. We found here a native of
the Friendly Islands, who called himself Fenow, and a
relation of the chief of that name of Tongataboo.<a name="FNanchor_49-3" id="FNanchor_49-3"></a><a href="#Footnote_49-3" class="fnanchor">[49-3]</a> Fenow
said he had seen Captain Cook and English ships at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
Friendly Islands, and that the natives of this island had
never seen a ship before they saw the <i>Pandora</i>. The island
is more than 30 miles long. A high mountain [4000 feet]
extends almost from one extremity to the other, which
tapers down gradually at the ends and sides to the sea
where it generally terminates in perpendicular cliffs of
moderate height, except in a few places where there is a
white beach of coral sand. The natives called the island
Otewhy;<a name="FNanchor_50-1" id="FNanchor_50-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-1" class="fnanchor">[50-1]</a> latitude of Northernmost point 13&deg; 27&#8242; 48&#8243; S.
Longitude 172&deg; 32&#8242; 13&#8243; W. South Point Latitude 13&deg; 46&#8242;
18&#8243; S., Longitude 172&deg; 18&#8242; 20&#8243; W., and East point in
Latitude 13&deg; 32&#8242; 20&#8243; S. and Longitude 172&deg; 2&#8242; W.</p>

<p>On the 21st we saw another island<a name="FNanchor_50-2" id="FNanchor_50-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-2" class="fnanchor">[50-2]</a> about 4 leagues to
the Eastward of this, and there are two small islands
between them, a small one in the middle and four off its
East end, three of which are of considerable height. There
is a greater variety of mountains and valleys in this than
in Chatham's and it is exceedingly well wooded, and the
trees of enormous size grow upon the very summits of the
mountains with spreading heads resembling the oak. The
same sort of trees were also seen in the same situation
at Chatham, but not in so great abundance. This island
is near forty miles long and of considerable breadth. The
natives called it Oattooah.<a name="FNanchor_50-3" id="FNanchor_50-3"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-3" class="fnanchor">[50-3]</a> Their canoes (although not
so well finished), language and some of their customs much
resemble those of the Friendly Islands, but they have some
peculiar to themselves&mdash;that of dyeing their skins yellow
and which is a mark of distinction amongst them is <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'one one'">one</ins>
of them.<a name="FNanchor_50-4" id="FNanchor_50-4"></a><a href="#Footnote_50-4" class="fnanchor">[50-4]</a> The Latitude of the West point is 13&deg; 52&#8242;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
25&#8243; S. and Longitude 171&deg; 49&#8242; 13&#8243; W. and the S.E. part in
Latitude 14&deg; 3&#8242; 30&#8243; S. and Longitude 171&deg; 12&#8242; 50&#8243; W. As
this island by our account was considerably to the Westward
of the Navigators' islands, we at first supposed it
to be a new discovery, but in visiting the other of the
Navigators' islands discovered by Mons. Bougainville
and running down again upon this we had reason to
suppose that the S.E. end of Oattooah had been seen by
him at a distance, and that it was the last island of the
group that he saw.<a name="FNanchor_51-1" id="FNanchor_51-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_51-1" class="fnanchor">[51-1]</a></p>

<p>Between five and six o'clock of the evening of the
22nd June lost sight of our tender in a thick shower of
rain. Some thought that they saw her light again at eight
o'clock, but in the morning she was not to be seen. We
cruised about for her in sight of the island on the 23rd
and 24th and as I could not find the tender near the place
where she was first lost, I thought it better to make
the best of my way to <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Annanooka'">Annamooka</ins>, the place appointed
as a last rendezvous and to endeavour to get there before
her, lest her small force should be a temptation to the
natives to attack her, and accordingly we stood to the
Southward.<a name="FNanchor_51-2" id="FNanchor_51-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_51-2" class="fnanchor">[51-2]</a> When we were to the Eastward of Oattooah
we saw another island bearing from us about E.S.E.
eight leagues. We afterwards knew that this was one
of the Navigators' islands seen by Mons. Bougainville.
On the morning of the 28th we saw the Happy [Haapai]
islands, and before noon a group of islands to the Eastward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
of Annamooka. We passed round to the Southward of
these islands and ran down between little Annamooka
and the Fallafagee isles and on the 29th anchored in
Annamooka Road.</p>

<p>Whilst we were watering the ship, &amp;c. I sent Lt. Hayward
to the Happy [Haapai] Islands in a double canoe, which I
hired of Tooboo a chief of these islands for the purpose of
examining them and to make inquiries after the <i>Bounty</i>
and the tender, but no intelligence could be got of either
of these vessels at these two islands, nor at either of the
Happy islands, and having completed our water and got a
plentiful supply of yams and a few hogs, we sailed from
thence on the 10th July. The natives were very daring in
their thefts, but some of the articles stolen were recovered
again by the chiefs, yet many of them were entirely lost,
and as I did not think it proper to carry things to extremities
on that occasion for fear that too much rigour
might operate to the disadvantage of the tender should
she arrive at the island in our absence, which I told them
I expected she would do, and that I intended to return
with the ship in about 20 days, and I left a letter of
instructions for the tender with Moukahkahlah, a resident
chief, which he promised to deliver. He is not the superior
chief, but we found him most useful to us and I thought
him the most worthy of trust.</p>

<p>Whilst we were at Annamooka, Fattahfahe [Fatafehi]<a name="FNanchor_52-1" id="FNanchor_52-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_52-1" class="fnanchor">[52-1]</a>
the chief of all the islands, and who generally resides at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
Tongataboo or Amsterdam Island, came to visit us, as
did also a great number of the chiefs from the adjacent
islands and to all of whom I gave presents and also to
such of their friends and attendances that were introduced
for the purpose of receiving favours. A person called
Toobou was the principal person in authority at Annamooka
when we arrived there. I learned that he belonged
to Tongataboo, and had little property on the island he
governed, and I supposed that he was a deputy or minister
of Fattahfahe who is generally acknowledged to be the
superior chief of all the islands known under the names
of the Friendly, Happy, and also of many other islands
unknown to us. Fattahfahe and Toobou were on board
the <i>Pandora</i> when she got under way, attended by two
large double sailing canoes, the largest of which had
upwards of 40 persons on board. I suppose that they
came on board to take leave and in expectation of getting
some additional farewell presents, in which they were
not disappointed.</p>

<p>I knew that Fattahfahe was shortly going to make a
tour of the Happy Islands, and as I perceived that he
was exceedingly well pleased with what I had given him,
and with his situation and accommodation on board the
ship, I invited him to come with us to Toofoa [Tofoa]
and Kaho [Kao], two islands I was then steering for and
that I intended to visit, as I thought he would be useful
by procuring us a favourable landing at Toofoa, the
island whose inhabitants had behaved so treacherously
to Lt. Bligh when he put in there for refreshments in
the <i>Bounty's</i> launch. Before the sun set we got within
a small distance of the island, but it was too late
for our boats to go on shore, and the canoes were
sent to the islands to announce the arrival of these
great chiefs; their coming in the ship I made no doubt
would increase their consequence, and probably also the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
tribute they might think proper to impose on their
subjects.</p>

<p>The next morning Lt. Corner, attended by the two
chiefs, was sent on shore at Toofoa to search and to make
the necessary inquiries after the <i>Bounty</i> and our tender, &amp;c.
and then to cross the channel which is about three or
four miles over, and to do the same at Kaho, and when I
saw the boat put off from Toofoa and stand over for the
other island I bore away with the ship and ran through the
channel between the two islands. At four in the afternoon
Lt. Corner, Fattahfahe and Toobou, returned on
board without success in their search and inquiries. The
two chiefs were put on board their canoes, and they made
sail for the Happy Islands.<a name="FNanchor_54-1" id="FNanchor_54-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_54-1" class="fnanchor">[54-1]</a></p>

<p>I now intended to have visited Tongataboo and the
other of the Friendly Islands, but, as the wind was
Southerly and unfavourable for the purpose, I took the
resolution once more to visit Oattooah, and also the
Navigators' Islands in search of the <i>Bounty</i> and our
tender and to endeavour to fall in to the eastward of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
islands. On the morning of the 12th we discovered a
cluster of islands bearing from us W. by S. to N.W. by N.,
but as the wind was favourable for us to proceed I did not
think it proper to lose time in examining them now, but
intended to do it on my return to the Friendly Islands.<a name="FNanchor_55-1" id="FNanchor_55-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-1" class="fnanchor">[55-1]</a></p>

<p>On the 14th, in the forenoon, we saw three islands,
which we supposed to be the three first islands seen by
Mons. Bougainville and part of the cluster called by him
"Navigators' Islands," the largest of these islands the
natives called Toomahnuah.<a name="FNanchor_55-2" id="FNanchor_55-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-2" class="fnanchor">[55-2]</a> We passed them at a convenient
distance and several canoes came towards the
ship, and it was with great difficulty that we prevailed
on them to come alongside, and still greater difficulty
to get them into the ship. They brought very few things
in their canoes except cocoanuts, which I bought, and
then gave them a few things as presents before they left
the ship, and after making the necessary inquiries as far
as our limited knowledge of the language would permit
us, I proceeded to the Westward and before daylight
on the morning of the 15th we saw another island. We
ran down on the North side of it and brought to occasionally
to find and take on board canoes.</p>

<p>We found the same shyness amongst the natives here
as at the last islands, but a few presents being given to
them they at last ventured on board. The island is
called by them Otootooillah.<a name="FNanchor_55-3" id="FNanchor_55-3"></a><a href="#Footnote_55-3" class="fnanchor">[55-3]</a> It is at least 5 leagues
long; we supposed it to be another of the islands seen by
Mons. Bougainville. We got soundings in 53 fathoms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
water, and the depth decreased as we stood in shore, and
there is probable anchorage on this side of the island
sheltered from the prevailing winds, but we did not see
the reef mentioned by Mons. Bougainville to run two
leagues from the West end.</p>

<p>After making inquiries after the <i>Bounty</i> and tender and
making presents to our visitors, we steered to the Westward,
inclining to the North and before night saw Oattooa,
bearing W.N.W. The South East end of this island was
also probably seen by Mons. Bougainville, but by his
description he could only have had a distant and a very
imperfect view of the island. On the 16th we ran down
on the South side of it, almost to the West end, and had
frequent communication with the natives, but could get
no information relative either to the <i>Bounty</i> or our tender.
We saw a few of the natives with blue, mulberry and other
coloured beads about their necks, and we understood
that they got them from Cook at Tongataboo, one of the
Friendly Islands. Having finished my business here, I
stood to the Southward with the intention of visiting
the group of islands we had discovered on our way hither,
and we got sight of them again in the afternoon of the
18th.<a name="FNanchor_56-1" id="FNanchor_56-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_56-1" class="fnanchor">[56-1]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th, in the morning we ran down on the North
side until we came to an opening through which we could
see the sea on the opposite side, and a kind of sound is
formed by some islands to the North East and some
islands of considerable size to the South West, and in the
intermediate space there are several small islands and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
rocks. On the larboard hand of the North entrance there
is a shoal, on which the sea appears to break although
there is from ten to twelve fathoms of water upon it. In
the other part of the entrance there is forty fathoms of
water or more. Our boat had only time to examine the
entrance and the larboard side of the sound, in which there
are interior bays where about 30 fathoms of water is to be
found within a cables length of the shore. The branches
of the sound on the starboard side, and which are yet
unexamined, appear to promise better anchorage than was
found on the opposite shore, and should it turn out so,
it will be by far the safest and best anchorage hitherto
known amongst the Friendly Islands.<a name="FNanchor_57-1" id="FNanchor_57-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_57-1" class="fnanchor">[57-1]</a></p>

<p>The natives told us there was good water at several
places within the sound, and there is plenty of wood.
Several of the inferior chiefs were on board us, amongst
whom were one of Fattahfahe's and one of Toobou's
family, but the principal chief of the island was not on
board, but we supposed he was coming at the time we
made sail.<a name="FNanchor_57-2" id="FNanchor_57-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_57-2" class="fnanchor">[57-2]</a> They brought on board yams, cocoanuts,
some bread fruit, and a few hogs and fowls, and would
have supplied us with more hogs had it been convenient
for us to have made a longer stay with them, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
they entreated us much to do. We found them very fair
in their dealings, very inoffensive and better behaved than
any savages we had yet seen.</p>

<p>They have frequent communication with Annamooka
and the other Friendly Islands, and their customs and
language appear to be nearly the same. I called the
whole group Howe's Islands. The islands on the larboard
side of the North entrance I distinguished by the names
of Barrington<a name="FNanchor_58-1" id="FNanchor_58-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-1" class="fnanchor">[58-1]</a> and Sawyer, two to the starboard side
with the names of Hotham<a name="FNanchor_58-2" id="FNanchor_58-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-2" class="fnanchor">[58-2]</a> and Jarvis.<a name="FNanchor_58-3" id="FNanchor_58-3"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-3" class="fnanchor">[58-3]</a> A high island
a considerable way to the North West I called Gardener's
island,<a name="FNanchor_58-4" id="FNanchor_58-4"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-4" class="fnanchor">[58-4]</a> and another high island to the South West was
called Bickerton's island.<a name="FNanchor_58-5" id="FNanchor_58-5"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-5" class="fnanchor">[58-5]</a> There is a small high isle
about four miles to the S.W. of this, and a small low
island about five or six miles to the S.E. by E. of
Gardener's island,<a name="FNanchor_58-6" id="FNanchor_58-6"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-6" class="fnanchor">[58-6]</a> and several islands to the S.E. of the
islands forming the sound and too several small islands
within it to which no names were given.</p>

<p>On the 20th at two in the morning, we passed within
two miles of the small island that lies to the S.E. from
Gardener's island, and soon after saw Gardener's island,
on the N.W. side of which there appeared to be tolerable
good landing on shingle beach, and a little to the right
of this place, at the upper edge of the cliffs is a volcano,
from which we observed the smoke issuing. There are
recent marks of convulsion having happened in the island.
Some parts of it appear to have fallen in, and other parts
to be turned upside down. This part of the island is the
most barren land we have seen in the country.<a name="FNanchor_58-7" id="FNanchor_58-7"></a><a href="#Footnote_58-7" class="fnanchor">[58-7]</a> At nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
o'clock thought we saw a large island bearing N. by W.
and I made sail towards it, and as the weather was hazy we
did not discover our mistake till near noon, when I hauled
the wind to the Southward. On the 23rd saw an island
from the masthead which I suppose was one of the
Pylstaart islands.<a name="FNanchor_59-1" id="FNanchor_59-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_59-1" class="fnanchor">[59-1]</a> On the 26th in the morning saw the
island of Middleburgh and on the 27th ran in between
Middleburgh, Eooa and Tongataboo.</p>

<p>Several canoes came on board us from the different
islands. We were then within half a mile of the last, and
equally near to the shoals of the second, but not so near
to Middleburgh, yet we were near enough to see into
English Road. At these islands we could neither see nor
get any satisfactory information relative to the objects
of our search. The natives brought in their canoes, yams,
cocoanuts and a few small hogs, and I made no doubt that
I should have been able to procure plenty of these articles
had it been convenient for me to have stayed at these
islands. The difficulty in getting in and out of the harbour
and the indifferent quality of the water were alone
sufficient objections against my stopping here. The road
at Annamooka was more convenient for getting out and
in, and the water, although not of the best quality, is
reported to be better than that found at Amsterdam
[Tongatabu], and Annamooka being the place I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
appointed as a rendezvous for the tender I did not hesitate
in giving the preference to it, and accordingly made the
best of my way thither, and we saw the Fallafagee islands
(which lie near Annamooka) [Kotu Group?] before dark,
and also Toofoa, Kaho and Hoonga Tonga islands to the
Westward, which are visible at a greater distance.</p>

<p>On the 28th July anchored in Annamooka Road. The
person who now had the principal authority on the shore
was a young chief whom we had not seen before. There
was the same respect paid to him as was paid to Fattahfahe
and to Toobou; neither of these chiefs nor Moukahkahlah
were now in the islands, and the natives were now more
daring in their thefts than ever, and would sometimes
endeavour to take things by force, and robbed and stripped
some of our people that were separated from the party.
Lt. Corner, who commanded the watering and wooding
parties on shore, received a blow on the head and was
robbed of a curiosity he had bought and held in his hand,
and with which the thief was making off. Lt. Corner
shot the thief in the back, and he fell to the ground;
at the same instant the natives attempted to take axes
and a saw from the wooding party, and actually got off
with two axes, one by force and the other by stealth,
but they did not succeed in getting the saw. Two muskets
were fired at the thieves, yet it was supposed that they
were not hurt, but we are told that the other man died
of his wound. One of the yawls was on shore at the
time, and the long boat was landing near her with an
empty cask. Lt. Corner drew the wooding and watering
parties towards the boats and then began to load them
with the wood that was cut.</p>

<p>A boat was sent from the ship to inquire the cause of
the firing that was heard, but before she returned a canoe
came from the shore to inform the principal chief (whom
I had brought on board to dine with me) that one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
natives had been killed by our people. The chief was very
much agitated at the information, and wanted to get out
of the cabin windows into the canoe, but I would not
suffer him to do it and told him I would go on shore with
him myself in a little time in one of the ship's boats. Our
boat soon returned and gave me an account of what had
passed on shore. I told the chief that the Lieutenant
had been struck, and that he and his party had been
robbed of several things, and that I was very glad that the
thief had been shot, and that I should shoot every person
who attempted to rob us, but that no other person except
the thief should be hurt by us on that account. The
axes and some other things that had been stolen before
were returned and very few robbings of any consequence
were attempted and discovered until the day of our departure.</p>

<p>I took this opportunity of showing the chief what
execution the cannon and carronades would do by firing
a six-pound shot on shore and an eighteen-pounder
carronade loaded with grape shot into the sea. I afterwards
went on shore with two boats and took with me
the chief and his attendants, and before I returned on
board again told him that I should send on shore the next
morning for water and wood, and that I should also
come on shore myself in the course of the day, all which
he approved of and desired me to do, and accordingly
the next morning, the 31st July the watering and wooding
parties were sent on shore and carried on their business
without interruption, and in the afternoon I went on shore
myself and made a small present to the chief and to some
other people.</p>

<p>On the 2nd August, having completed my water, &amp;c.
and thinking it time to return to England I did not think
proper to wait any longer for the tender, but left instructions
for her commander should she happen to arrive after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
my departure, and I sailed from Annamooka, attended by
a number of chiefs and canoes belonging to those and the
surrounding islands. After the ship was under way
some of the natives had the address to get in at the cabin
windows and stole out of the cabin some books and other
things, and they had actually got into their canoes before
they were discovered. The thieves were allowed to make
their escape, but the canoes that had stolen these things
were brought alongside and broke up for firewood. During
this transaction the other natives carried on their traffic
alongside with as much unconcern as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>I made farewell presents to all the chiefs and to many
others of different descriptions, and after hauling round
Annamooka shoals, passed to the Eastward of Toofoa
and Kaho, and in the morning saw Bickerton's island
and the small island to the Southward of it. On the 4th,
in the evening, saw land bearing N.N.W. At first we
took it to be Keppel's and Boscowen's islands, which I
intended to visit, and by account was only a few miles
to the Westward of them. As we approached the land we
perceived that it was only one island, and as I supposed that
it was a new discovery I called it Proby's island.<a name="FNanchor_62-1" id="FNanchor_62-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_62-1" class="fnanchor">[62-1]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
hills, of which there are a great many of different heights
and forms, are planted with cocoanuts and other trees,
and the houses of a larger size than we had usually seen on
the islands in these seas; were on the tops of hills of
moderate height. We passed from S.E. end to the East,
round to the North and N.W.</p>

<p>Landing appeared to be very indifferent until we came
near the N.W., where the land formed itself into a kind of
bay, and where the landing appeared to be better. The
natives brought on board cocoanuts and plantains, all of
which I bought, and made them a present of a few articles
of iron. They told us that they had water, hogs, fowls
and yams on shore and plenty of wood. They spoke
nearly the same language as at the Friendly Islands. It
lies in latitude 15&deg; 53&#8242; S. and longitude 175&deg; 51&#8242; W. I
was now convinced that I was rather further to the Westward
than I expected, and examining the island had carried
me still further that way. I therefore gave up my intention
of visiting <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Boscawen&#39;s'">Boscowen's</ins> and Keppel's islands,<a name="FNanchor_63-1" id="FNanchor_63-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_63-1" class="fnanchor">[63-1]</a> as the
regaining the Easting necessary would take up more time
than would be prudent to allow at this advanced time of
the season, and as soon as I had made the necessary
inquiries, &amp;c., after the <i>Bounty</i>, &amp;c., our course was shaped
with a view to fall in to the Eastward of Wallis' Island,<a name="FNanchor_63-2" id="FNanchor_63-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_63-2" class="fnanchor">[63-2]</a>
and the next day, the 5th, a little before noon saw that
island bearing West by South, estimated by the master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
at ten leagues, but I did not myself suppose it to be more
than seven leagues from us at that time.</p>

<p>Canoes came off to us and brought us cocoanuts and fish,
which they sold for nails, and I also made them a present
of some small articles which I always made a rule to do to
first adventurers, hoping that it might turn out advantageous
to future visitors, but they went away before I
had given them all I intended. They told us that there
was running water, hogs and fowls on shore. They spoke
the language of the Friendly Islands, and I observed
that one of the men had both of his little fingers cut off,
and the flesh over his cheekbones very much bruised
after the manner of the natives of those islands.<a name="FNanchor_64-1" id="FNanchor_64-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_64-1" class="fnanchor">[64-1]</a></p>

<p>In the evening I bore away and made sail to the Westward
intending to run between Espiritu Santo and Santa
Cruz, and to keep between the tracks of Captain Carteret
and Lt. Bligh, and on the 8th at 10 at night saw land
bearing from the W. by S. We had no ground at
110 fathoms. At daylight I bore away and passed round
the East end and ran down on the South side of the island.
There is a white beach on these parts of the island on
which there appears to be tolerable good landing, or better
than is usually seen on the islands in these seas, and there
is probably anchorage in different places on this side or
under the small islands, of which there are several near
the principal island, but as I did not hoist out the boats
to sound that still remains a doubt.</p>

<p>There are cocoanut trees all along the shore behind
the beach, and an uncommon number of boughs amongst
them. The island is rather high, diversified with hills
of different forms, some of which might obtain the name
of mountain, but they are cultivated up to their very
summits with cocoanut trees and other articles, and the
island is in general as well or better cultivated and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
inhabitants more numerous for its size than any of the
islands we have hitherto seen. The principal island is
about 7 miles long and three or four broad, but including
the islands off its East and West ends, and which latter
are joined to it by a reef, it is about ten miles long. I
called it Grenville Island [Rotuma], supposing it to be a
new discovery. Its latitude is 12&deg; 29&#8242; and longitude
183&deg; 03&#8242; W.</p>

<p>A great number of paddling canoes came off and viewed
the ship at a distance, and I believed that their intentions
were at first hostile. They were all armed with clubs and
they had a great quantity of stones in their canoes which
they use in battle, and they all occasionally joined in
a kind of war-whoop. We made signs of peace, and
offered them a variety of toys which drew them alongside,
and then into the ship where they behaved very quietly;
probably the unexpected presents they got from us, and
our number and strength might operate in favour of peace.
However, they seemed to have the same propensity to
thieving as the natives of the other islands, and gave us
many, some of which ludicrous, examples.</p>

<p>Although at so great a distance they said that they
were acquainted with the Friendly islands, and had
learned from them the use of iron.<a name="FNanchor_65-1" id="FNanchor_65-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_65-1" class="fnanchor">[65-1]</a> They were tattooed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
in a different manner from the natives of the other islands
we had visited, having the figure of a fish, birds and a
variety of other things marked upon their arms. Their
canoes were not so delicately formed nor so well finished
as at the Friendly islands, but more resemble those of the
Duke of York's, the Duke of Clarence's and the Navigators'
islands. Neither sailing or double canoes came on
board, neither did we see any of either of these descriptions.
They told us that water and many other useful things,
the usual produce of the islands in these seas, could be
procured on shore.</p>

<p>Their language appeared something to resemble that
spoken at the Friendly islands, and after asking them
such questions as we thought necessary, some of which
probably were not understood perfectly by them, or their
answers by us, we made sail and continued our course to
the Westward. No women were seen in the canoes that
visited us, which curiosity or the hope of getting some
pleasing toys usually bring to our side, but this is another
proof that their original intentions were hostile. We
passed the island in so short a time that those who
neglected to come out at our first appearance had not
afterwards the opportunity to visit us.</p>

<p>On the 11th at eleven o'clock in the morning we struck
soundings on a bank in twelve to fourteen fathoms water
and at ten minutes after eleven had no ground in one
hundred and forty fathoms. No land was then in sight,
nor did we get any soundings after in the course of the
day. It was called Pandora's Bank, its Latitude 12&deg; 11&#8242; S.
and Longitude 188&deg; 68&#8242; W.</p>

<p>On the next morning saw a small island which met in
two high hummocks and a steeple rock which lies high on
the West side of the hummocks. It obtained the name of
Mitre Island. The shore appeared to be steep to, and we
had no bottom at 120 fathoms within three quarters of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
mile of the shore. There was no landing place or sign of
inhabitants. The tops of the hills were covered with
wood. There was also some on the sides, but not in so
great an abundance they being too steep and too bare
of soil in some places to support it. Latitude 11&deg; 49&#8242;
S. and Longitude 190&deg; 04&#8242; 30&#8243; W.<a name="FNanchor_67-1" id="FNanchor_67-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_67-1" class="fnanchor">[67-1]</a></p>

<p>By nine o'clock we had passed it and steered to the
Westward, and soon afterwards we saw another island
bearing N.W. by N. We hauled up to the N.W. to make
it out more distinctly as it is of considerable height, yet
not much more than a mile long, and the top and the
side of the hills very well cultivated and a number of
houses were seen near the beach in a bay on the South
side of the island. The beach from the East round to the
South of the West end is of white sand, but there was then
too much surf for the ship's boat to land upon it with
safety. I called it Cherry's Island [Native name: Anula].
Its Latitude is 11&deg; 37&#8242; S. and Longitude 190&deg; 19&#8242; 30&#8243; W.<a name="FNanchor_67-2" id="FNanchor_67-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_67-2" class="fnanchor">[67-2]</a></p>

<p>On the 13th August a little before noon we saw an
island bearing about N.W. by N. In general it is high,
but to the West and North West the mountain tapered
down to a round point of moderate height. It abounds
with wood, even the summits of the mountain are covered
with trees. In the S.E. end there was the appearance of a
harbour, and from that place the reef runs along the South
side to the Westernmost extremity. In some places its
distance is not much more than a mile from the shore, in
other places it is considerably more. Although we were
sometimes within less than a mile of the reef we saw
neither house nor people. The haziness of the weather
prevented us from seeing objects distinctly, yet we saw
smoke very plain, from which it may be presumed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
the island is inhabited. It is six or seven leagues long
and of considerable breadth. I called it Pitt's Island.
Its Latitude is 11&deg; 50&#8242; 30&#8243; S. South point, and Longitude
193&deg; 14&#8242; 15&#8243; W.<a name="FNanchor_68-1" id="FNanchor_68-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_68-1" class="fnanchor">[68-1]</a></p>

<p>At midnight between the 16th and 17th of August
breakers were discovered ahead and upon our bow,
and not a mile from us. We were lying to and heaving
the lead at the time and had no ground at 120 fathoms.
We wore the ship and stood from them and in less than an
hour after more breakers were seen extending more than a
point before our lee beam, but we made more sail and so
got clear of them all. At daylight we put about with the
intention of examining the breakers we had seen in the
night and we made two boards, but perceiving that I
could not weather them without some risk I bore up and
ran round its N.W. end. It is a double reef enclosing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
a space of deeper water like the lagoon islands so common
in these seas, and probably will become one in the course
of time. The sea breaks pretty high upon it in different
parts, but there is no part of the reef absolutely above
water. It is about seven miles long in the direction of
N.W. by N. Its breadth is not so much. Called it
Willis's shoal. It lies in Latitude 12&deg; 20&#8242; S. and Longitude
200&deg; 2&#8242; W.<a name="FNanchor_69-1" id="FNanchor_69-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_69-1" class="fnanchor">[69-1]</a></p>

<p>We pursued our course to the Westward and on the
23rd saw the land bearing from N.E. to N. by W. The
Easternmost land when first seen was ten or twelve
leagues from us and it cannot be far to the Westward
of the land seen by Mons. Bougainville and called by him
Louisiade, and probably joins to it. The cape is in
Latitude 10&deg; 3&#8242; 32&#8243; S. and Longitude 212&deg; 14&#8242; W., was
called Cape Rodney and another cape in Latitude 9&deg;
58&#8242; S. and Longitude 212&deg; 37&#8242; W. was called Cape Hood,
and an island lying between them was called Mount
Clarence. After passing Cape Hood the land appears
lower and to branch off about N.N.W. and to form a
deep and wide bay, or perhaps a passage through, for we
saw no other land, and there are doubts whether it joins
New Guinea or not.<a name="FNanchor_69-2" id="FNanchor_69-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_69-2" class="fnanchor">[69-2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>I pursued my course to the Westward between the
Latitudes of 10&deg; and 9&deg; 33&#8242; S. keeping the mouth of Endeavour
Straits open, by which I hoped to avoid the
difficulties and dangers experienced by Captain Cook in
his passage through the reef in a higher latitude, and also
the difficulties he met with when within in his run from
thence to the Strait's mouth.<a name="FNanchor_70-1" id="FNanchor_70-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_70-1" class="fnanchor">[70-1]</a></p>

<p>On the 25th August at 9 in the morning, saw
breakers from the mast head bearing from us W. by S.
to W.N.W. I hauled up to the Southward and passed
to the Eastward of them. It runs in the direction of
W.S.W. and E.N.E. 4&#8242; or 5&#8242;, and another side runs in the
direction of N.W. the distance unknown. The sea broke
very moderately upon it, in some places barely perceptibly.
In the interior part a very small sand-bank was seen from
the mast-head, and no other part of the reef was above
water. It obtained the name of Look-Out shoal.<a name="FNanchor_70-2" id="FNanchor_70-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_70-2" class="fnanchor">[70-2]</a></p>

<p>Before noon we saw more breakers which proved to
be one of those half-formed islands enclosing a lagoon,
the reef of which was composed principally of very large
stones, but a sandbank was seen from the mast head
extending to the Southward of it, and as I could not
weather it and seeing another opening to the Westward,
I steered to the W.S.W., and a little before two o'clock saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
the island to the Westward of us, and another reef bearing
about S.W. by South and I then steered W. &frac12; N. until half
past five, when a reef was seen extending from the island a
considerable way to the N.W., the island bearing then
about W.S.W. I immediately hauled upon the wind in
order to pass to the Southward of it, and seeing a passage
to the Northward obstructed<a name="FNanchor_71-1" id="FNanchor_71-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_71-1" class="fnanchor">[71-1]</a> I stood on and off, and
was still during the night, and in the morning bore away;
but as we drew near we also saw a reef extending to the
Southward from the South end of the island. I ran to
the Southward along the reef with the intention and
expectation of getting round it, and the whole day was
spent without succeeding in my purpose and without
seeing the end of the reef, or any break in it that gave the
least hopes of a channel fit for a ship.<a name="FNanchor_71-2" id="FNanchor_71-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_71-2" class="fnanchor">[71-2]</a></p>

<p>The islands, which I called Murray's Islands, are four
in number, two of them are of considerable height and may
be seen twelve leagues. The principal island is not more
than three miles long. It is well wooded and at the top
of the highest hill the rocks have the appearance of a
fortified garrison. The other high island is only a single
mountain almost destitute of trees and verdure. The
other two are only crazy barren rocks. We saw three two
mast boats under sail near the reef, which we supposed
belong to the islands. Murray Islands lie in Latitude
9&deg; 57&#8242; S. and Longitude 216&deg; 43&#8242; W. We kept turning to
the Southward along the reef until the 28th in search
of a channel and in the forenoon of that day we thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
we saw an opening through the reef near a white sandy
island or key, and a little before Lt. Corner was sent in the
yawl to examine it. At <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'threequarters'">three quarters</ins> past four he made
the signal that there was a channel through the reef fit
for a ship, and after a signal was made and repeated for
the boat to return on board, and after dark false fires and
muskets were fired from the ship, and answered with
muskets by the boat repeatedly to point out the situation
of each other. We sounded frequently but had no
ground at 110 fathoms.</p>

<p>At about twenty minutes after seven the boat was seen
close in under our stern and at the same time we got
soundings in 50 fathoms water. We immediately made
sail, but before the tacks were on board and the sails
trimmed the ship struck upon the reef when we were
getting 4&frac14; less 2 fathoms water on the larboard side,
and 3 fathoms on the starboard side. Got out the boats
with a view to carrying out an anchor, but before it
could be effected the ship struck so heavily on the reef
that the carpenters reported that she made 18 inches of
water in five minutes, and in five minutes after there was
four feet of water in the hold. Finding the leak increase
so fast found it necessary to turn all hands to the pumps
and to bale at the different hatchways. She still continued
to gain upon us so much that under an hour and
a half after she had struck there was eight feet of water in
the hold, and we perceived that the ship had beat over
the reef where we had 10 fathoms water. We let go the
small bower and veered away the cable and let go the
best bower under foot in 15 fathoms water to steady
the ship. At this time the water only gained upon us in
a small degree and we flattered ourselves for some time
that by the assistance of a top sail which we were preparing
and intended to haul under the ship's bottom we
might be able to free her of water, but these flattering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
hopes did not continue long, for as she settled in the water
the leaks increased and in so great a degree that there was
reason to apprehend that she would sink before daylight.</p>

<p>In the course of the night two of the pumps were for some
time rendered useless, one, however was repaired, and we
continued baling and pumping the remainder of the night
and every effort was made to keep her afloat.<a name="FNanchor_73-1" id="FNanchor_73-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_73-1" class="fnanchor">[73-1]</a> Daylight
fortunately appeared and gave us the opportunity to see
our situation and the surrounding danger. Our boats
were kept astern of the ship; a small quantity of provisions
and other necessaries were put into them, rafts
were made, and all floating things upon the deck were
unlashed. At half past six the hold was filled with water,
and water was between decks and it also washed in at
the upper deck ports, and there were strong indications
that the ship was upon the very point of sinking, and we
began to leap overboard and to take to the boats, and
before everybody could get out of her the ship actually
sank.<a name="FNanchor_73-2" id="FNanchor_73-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_73-2" class="fnanchor">[73-2]</a> The boats continued astern on the ship in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
direction of the drift of the tide from here, and took
up the people that had held on to the rafts or other
floating things that had been cast loose for the purpose
of supporting them in the water.<a name="FNanchor_74-1" id="FNanchor_74-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_74-1" class="fnanchor">[74-1]</a></p>

<p>We loaded two of the boats with people and sent them
to the island, or rather key, about three or four miles from
the ship, and then other two boats remained near the ship
for some time and picked up all the people that could be
seen and then followed the two first boats to the key, and
after landing the people, &amp;c. the boats were immediately
sent again to look about the wreck and the adjoining
reefs for missing people, but they returned without having
found a single person. On mustering we discovered that
89 of the ship's company and 10 of the pirates that were on
board were saved, and that 31<a name="FNanchor_74-2" id="FNanchor_74-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_74-2" class="fnanchor">[74-2]</a> of the ship's company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
and 4 pirates were lost with the ship. The boats were
hauled up and secured to fit them for the intended run
to Timor; an account was taken of the provision and other
articles saved, and they were spread to dry, and we put
ourselves to the following allowance, to 3 ounces of bread,
which was occasionally reduced to 2 ounces, to half an
ounce of portable soup, to half an ounce of essence of
malt, (but these two articles were not served until after
we left the key, and they were at other times withheld),
to two small glasses of water and one of wine.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 30th sent a boat to the wreck
to see if anything could be procured. She returned
with the head of the T.G. mast, a little of the T.G. rigging,
and part of the chain of the lightning conductor, but
without a single article of provision. The boat was also
sent to examine the channel through the reef &amp;c. and was
afterwards sent a-fishing. She lost her grapnel, but no
fish were caught.</p>

<p>On the 31st the boats were completed and were launched,
and we put everything we had saved on board of them and
at half past ten in the forenoon we embarked, 30 on board
the launch, 25 in the pinnace, 23 in one yawl and 21 in
the other yawl.<a name="FNanchor_75-1" id="FNanchor_75-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_75-1" class="fnanchor">[75-1]</a> We steered N.W. by W. and W.N.W.
within the reef. This channel through the reef is better
than any hitherto known, besides the advantage it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
of being situated further to the North, by which many
difficulties would be avoided when within the reef. In
the run from thence to the entrance of Endeavour Straits
there is a small white island or key on the larboard end
of the channel, which lies in Latitude 11&deg; 23&#8242; S., the sides
are strong and irregular.</p>

<p>On the 1st September in the morning saw land, which
probably was the continent of New South Wales. The
yawls were sent on shore to ground and look out. They
saw a run of water, landed and filled their two barricois,
which were the only vessels of consequence they had with
them, and I steered for an island called by Lt. Bligh
Mountainous Island, and when joined by the boats ran
into a bay of that island where we saw Indians on the
beach. The water was shoal and the Indians waded off
to the boats. I gave them some presents and made them
sensible that we were in want of water. They brought
us a vessel filled with water which we had given them for
the purpose, and they returned to fill it again. They
used many signs to signify that they wished us to land,
but we declined their invitation from motives of
prudence.</p>

<p>Just as a person was entering the water with the second
vessel of fresh water, an arrow was discharged at us by
another person, which struck my boat on the quarter,
and perceiving that they were collecting bows and arrows
a volley of small arms was fired at them which put them
to flight. I did not think proper to land and get water
by force as land was seen at that time in different directions,
which by appearance was likely to produce that
article, and which I flattered myself we might be able
to procure without being drove to that extremity. I
therefore ran close along the shore of this island and
landed at different places at some distance from the former
situation. I also landed at another island near it which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
called Plum Island<a name="FNanchor_77-1" id="FNanchor_77-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_77-1" class="fnanchor">[77-1]</a> from its producing a species of that
fruit, but we were unsuccessful in finding the article we
were in search of, and in so much want of.</p>

<p>In the evening we steered for the islands which we
supposed were those called by Captain Cook the Prince
of Wales' Islands, and before midnight came to a grapnel
with the boats near one of these islands, in a large sound
formed by several of the surrounding islands, to several
of which we gave names, and called the sound Sandwich
Sound.<a name="FNanchor_77-2" id="FNanchor_77-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_77-2" class="fnanchor">[77-2]</a> It is fit for the reception of ships, having from
five to seven fathoms of water. There is plenty of wood
on most of the islands, and by digging we found very
good water. On the flat part of a large island which I
called Lafory's Island,<a name="FNanchor_77-3" id="FNanchor_77-3"></a><a href="#Footnote_77-3" class="fnanchor">[77-3]</a> situated on the larboard hand as
we entered the sound from the Eastward we saw a burying
place and several wolves<a name="FNanchor_77-4" id="FNanchor_77-4"></a><a href="#Footnote_77-4" class="fnanchor">[77-4]</a> near the watering place,
but we saw no natives. Here we filled our vessels with
water and made two canvas bags in which we also put
water, but with this assistance we had barely the means
to take a gallon of water for each man in the boats. We
sent our kettles on shore and made tea and portable
broth, and a few oysters were picked off the rocks with
which we made a comfortable meal, indeed the only
one we had made since the day before we left the ship.</p>

<p>On the 2nd September at half past three in the afternoon
we stood out of the North entrance of the sound.
Before five we saw a reef extending from the North to
the W.N.W. and which appeared to run in the latter
direction or more to the Westward.<a name="FNanchor_77-5" id="FNanchor_77-5"></a><a href="#Footnote_77-5" class="fnanchor">[77-5]</a> On the edge of
this reef we had 3&frac14; fathoms of water and after hauling to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
the S.W. we soon deepened our water to 5 fathoms. Besides
Mountainous and West Islands seen by Lt. Bligh
we saw several other islands between the North and the
West, one of which I called Hawkesbury Island. We
saw several large turtle.</p>

<p>In the evening we saw the Northernmost extremity of
New South Wales, which forms the South side of Endeavour
Straits. At night the boats took each other in
tow and we steered to the Westward.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to retail our particular sufferings in
the boats during our run to Timor and it is sufficient to
observe that we suffered more from heat and thirst than
from hunger, and that our strength was greatly decreased.<a name="FNanchor_78-1" id="FNanchor_78-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_78-1" class="fnanchor">[78-1]</a>
We fortunately had good weather, and the sea was generally
not very rough, and the boats were more buoyant and
lively in the water that we reasonably could have expected
considering the weight and numbers we had in them.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the morning of the 13th September
we saw the island of Timor bearing N.W. We continued
our course to the W.N.W. till noon, but the other boats
hauled for the land and we separated from them. At
one o'clock we were well in with the land and a party was
sent on shore in search of water, but none was found
here, nor at several other places we examined as we passed
along the coast, until the next morning, when good water
was found. We also bought a few small fish, which when
divided afforded some two or three ounces per man.
Here the launch joined us again. They informed us that
they had got a supply of water the evening before.</p>

<p>On the 15th in the morning saw the island of Rotte.
At half past three in the afternoon entered the Straits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
of Samoa. Before midnight we came to a grapnel off
the float or Coopang and found here one ship, a ketch
and two or three small craft. The launch separated from
us soon after dark to get up to Coopang the next day
in the forenoon. On the morning of the 16th by our
account (which was the 17th in this country) at daylight
we hailed the fort and informed them whom we were.
A small boat was sent to us, and myself and Lt. Hayward
landed at the usual place near the Chinese Temple
where we were received by the Lt. Governor, Mr. Fruy
and Mr. Bouberg, Capt. Lieutenant of a Company ship
that lay in the road, and conducted by them to Governor
Wanjon, who received us with great humanity and goodness
of heart. Refreshments were immediately prepared
for myself and the lieutenant. Provision was provided,
the people ordered to land, and they all dined in the
Governor's own house, and an arrangement was made for
the reception and accommodation of the whole party
as they arrived.</p>

<p>The church and the church-yard was assigned for the
use of the private seamen, a house was hired for the
warrant and petty officers. The people that were ill
were put under the care of Mr. Zimers, the Surgeon-General.
Governor Wanjon did me and Lt. Hayward
the honour of lodging and entertaining us in his own
house. Mr. Corner, the second Lieutenant and Mr.
Bentham, the Purser, were received in the house of
Mr. Fruy, the Lieutenant-Governor. Lt. Larkin and Mr.
Passmore were taken into the house of Mr. Brouberg,
the Captain-Lieutenant of the Company ship, and Mr.
Hamilton, the surgeon, was accommodated in the house
of Mr. Zimers, the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Surgeon General'">Surgeon-General</ins>, and Governor Wanjon
did everything in his power to supply our present wants,
or that would contribute to the re-establishment of our
health and strength and even to our amusement, and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
benevolent example was followed by Mr. Fruy, the
Lieutenant-Governor and the other gentlemen of the place.
Two months' provision was provided for the ship's company
and put on board the <i>Remberg</i> [<i>Rembang</i>], a Dutch
East India Company ship, and we embarked on board
the same ship for Batavia on the 6th October, 1791.<a name="FNanchor_80-1" id="FNanchor_80-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_80-1" class="fnanchor">[80-1]</a></p>

<p>Before we sailed Governor Wanjon delivered to me
eight men, one woman and two children who came to
Coopang in June last in a six-oared cutter. They are
supposed to be late deserters from the colony at Port
Jackson. Food bills were given on the different departments
of the Navy for the provisions and other necessaries
we were supplied with at Coopang and also for the maintenance
and cloathing of the convicts. I sold one of the yawls
to the Lieutenant-Governor and the longboat and the
other yawl to the Commander of the <i>Remberg</i>, the ship in
which we embarked. The latter was not to be delivered
up until I left Batavia, and I shall make myself accountable
to the Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy for the
amount. As I could take no more boats with me and the
pinnace being out of repair, I left her with the Governor
Wanjon with permission to do with her what he thought
proper.</p>

<p>We stopped at Samarang, being an island of Java,
where we had the good fortune to be joined by our tender
that had separated from us off the island of Oattoah.
She had all her people on board except one man, whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
they had buried a few days before. She had been stopped
at Java on suspicion, and they were going to send her to
Batavia. Mr. Overstratin, the Governor of the place,
delivered her up to me. The tender had contracted
a small debt for provisions &amp;c. at Java, which I shall
discharge. She fell in to the Westward of Annamooka,
the island I had appointed to rendezvous on, without
seeing it, and then steered two days to the Westward
nearly in its latitude and fell in with an island which I
suppose must be one of the Fiji Islands, where they had
waited for me five weeks, and then proceeded through
Endeavour Straits and intended to stop at Batavia.
With the iron and salt I had provided them with they were
enabled to procure and preserve sufficient provision for
their run to Java.</p>

<p>I arrived at Batavia on the 7th November and on
application to the Governor and Council my people were
put on board a Dutch East India Company's ship that
was lying in the Road to be kept there until they could
be sent to Europe, and the sick were ordered to be received
by the Company's hospital at Batavia, and I have since
agreed with the Dutch East India Company to divide
my ship's company into four parts, and to embark them
on board four of their ships for Holland at no expense to
the Government further than for the officers and prisoners,
which appeared to me to be the most eligible and least
expensive way of getting to England. Lt. Larkin, two
petty officers, and eighteen seamen embarked on the <i>Zwan</i>,
a Dutch East India ship on the 19th November and are
sailing for Europe, and myself and the remainder of the
<i>Pandora's</i> company and the prisoners are to embark as
soon as their ships are manned. Myself and the pirates
are to embark on board the <i>Vreedenberg</i>, Captain Christian
and I have stipulated that myself and the prisoners may
be at liberty to go on board any of His Majesty's ships,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
or other vessels we may meet with on mine or my officer's
application for the purpose.</p>

<p>Enclosed is the latitudes and longitudes of several
islands, &amp;c. we discovered during our voyage, the state
of the <i>Pandora's</i> company, a list of pirates belonging to
the <i>Bounty</i>, taken at Otaheite and a list of convicts,
deserters from the colony at Port Jackson. It may be
necessary to observe that these last have several names,
and that William Bryant and James Cox pretend that their
time of transportation has expired, but these two then
found a boat and money to procure necessaries to enable
themselves and others to escape, for which I presume they
are liable to punishment, and think it my duty to give
information.</p>

<p>Although I have not had the good fortune to fully
accomplish the object of my voyage, and that it has in
other respects been strongly marked with great misfortunes,
I hope it will be thought that the first is not for
want of perseverence, or the latter for want of the care
and attention of myself and those under my command,
but that the disappointment and misfortune arose from
the difficulties and peculiar circumstances of the service
we were upon; that those of my orders I have been able
to fulfil, with the discoveries that have been made will be
some compensation for the disappointment and misfortunes
that have attended us, and should their Lordships
upon the whole think that the voyage will be profitable
to our country it will be a great consolation to,</p>

<p>Agreeable to my intentions which I did myself
the honour to signify to you in a letter addressed from
Batavia and sent by a Dutch packet bound to Europe,
I embarked the remainder of the Company of His Majesty's
ship <i>Pandora</i>, pirates late belonging to the <i>Bounty</i> and
the convicts deserters from Port Jackson, on board three
Dutch East India ships as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Myself, the master, Purser, Gunner, Clerk, two midshipmen,
twentyone seamen, and ten pirates on board the
<i>Vreedenburg</i>, bound to Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Lt. Corner, the surgeon, three midshipmen, fourteen
seamen, and half the convicts on board the <i>Horssen</i>,
bound to Rotterdam, and Lt. Hayward, the boatswain,
surgeon's mate, three midshipmen, fifteen seamen and the
other half of the convicts on board the <i>Hoornwey</i>, bound
to Rotterdam.</p>

<p>Lt. Larkin with two petty officers and eighteen seamen
were embarked on board the <i>Zwan</i> and sailed from
Batavia previous to the date of my former letter, and I
am now informed that she has been at this port and sailed
from hence for Europe more than a month before my
arrival.</p>

<p>I found His Majesty's Ship <i>Gorgon</i> here on her return

and greater security I intend to avail myself of the opportunity

Ship <i>Gorgon</i> at the Cape of Good Hope on my arrival
there in the <i>Vreedenburg</i>, a Dutch East India Company's

the <i>Bounty</i>, and the convicts, deserters from Port Jackson
(whom I had under my charge on board the Dutch East

<p>I beg leave to acquaint you that I have information
that the <i>Vreedenburg</i> and the <i>Horssen</i>, two Dutch East India
Company's ships, on board of which part of the company of
His Majesty's ship <i>Pandora</i> are embarked, were off the
Start on the 5th of this month, on their way to Holland,
and that the <i>Hoornwey</i>, the ship on board which the remainder
of the company of the <i>Pandora</i> were embarked,
was expected to sail from the Cape of Good Hope in about
three weeks after the two former ships left that place,
but the account does not mention the day they left the
Cape themselves.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30-1" id="Footnote_30-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30-1"><span class="label">[30-1]</span></a> They sighted Easter Island on March 4th, 1791, Ducie's Island on
the 16th, Hoods' Island on the 17th, and Carysfort on the 19th. The
latitude and description of Ducie's Island leaves little doubt that it
was the first island discovered by Quiros on January 26th, 1606 and
called by him Luna Puesta. It appears as Encarna&ccedil;ion in Espinosa's
chart. Quiros thus describes it: "A buen juzgar dista de Lima ochocientas
leguas: tiene cinco de boj, mucha arboleda y playas de arena,
y junto &aacute; tierra fondo de ochenta brazas." Had Edwards but sailed
due west from Ducie Island he must have sighted Pitcairn and discovered
the hiding-place of Fletcher Christian's ill-fated colony.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31-1" id="Footnote_31-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31-1"><span class="label">[31-1]</span></a> An American vessel.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33-1" id="Footnote_33-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33-1"><span class="label">[33-1]</span></a> Morrison was Boatswain's Mate of the <i>Bounty</i>. He had previously
served as midshipman in the navy, and by talent and education he was
far above the station he held in Bligh's ship. It was he who planned
and directed the building of the fast-sailing little schooner which acted
as the <i>Pandora's</i> tender, was the first vessel to anchor in Fiji, and made
the record passage from China to the Sandwich Islands. Morrison was
chaplain as well as foreman to the little band of shipwrights. On
Sundays he hoisted the English colours on a staff and read the Church
Service to them. He kept a journal, not only throughout the <i>Bounty's</i>
cruise, but during his sojourn with the mutineers in Tahiti, and, though
it is not explained how he contrived to preserve it through the wreck
of the <i>Pandora</i> and the boat voyage, there can be no doubt that it was
a genuine document. At Captain Heywood's death it passed with his
other papers to his daughters. This journal has been annotated and
corrected by another hand, probably Heywood's own, but without
material alteration of the sense. It is filled with acrimony against
Bligh from the outset of the <i>Bounty's</i> cruise, and the form of the
entries shows that it was intended to be the basis for laying serious
charges against him when the ship was paid off. It is needless to add
that it does not spare Edwards in respect of his treatment of his
prisoners.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37-5" id="Footnote_37-5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37-5"><span class="label">[37-5]</span></a> Morrison said that his plan was to reach Batavia in time to secure
a passage home in the next fleet bound to Holland, and that the return
to Tahiti was occasioned, not by any distrust of his talents, but by the
refusal of the natives, who were anxious to keep them in Tahiti, to
victual the ship for so long a voyage. There were no casks on the
schooner for storing water. Morrison, Heywood and Stewart had
planned an escape from Tubuai in the <i>Bounty's</i> boat, but, fortunately
for them&mdash;since the attempt would have been certain death&mdash;their plan
was discovered and frustrated by the other mutineers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38-1" id="Footnote_38-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38-1"><span class="label">[38-1]</span></a> Oliver, master's mate; Renouard, midshipman; James Dodds,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40-1" id="Footnote_40-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40-1"><span class="label">[40-1]</span></a> Oatafu, one of the Union Group, discovered by Commodore Byron
in 1765. If the mutineers had settled there they would have starved,
for there is neither food nor water. Since Byron's discovery a native
settlement has been made from Bowditch Island (Fakaago), and the
people, about 100 in number, live on fish, pandanus, and water caught
in holes cut on the lee side of the cocoa-palms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40-2" id="Footnote_40-2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40-2"><span class="label">[40-2]</span></a> The northernmost island of the Cook Group, discovered by Bligh,
April 11, 1798, a few days before the mutiny. In 1823 John Williams,
the missionary, heard at Rarotonga a native tradition of Bligh's visit.
The natives heard the first rumours of a world beyond their own from
two Tahitian castaways who had seen Captain Cook, and had with them
an iron hatchet obtained from the <i>Resolution</i>. They represented the
strange beings who traversed the ocean in vast canoes, not lashed with
sinnet nor furnished with outriggers, as impious people who laughed
at the tabu, and even ate of the consecrated food from the Mara&eacute;s.
They were like the gods; if they were attacked they blew at their
assailants with long blow-pipes (pupuhi) from which flames and stones
were belched. Such were the Tut&euml; (Cooks)<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing period">.</ins> Thereafter, having need
of iron (kurima) and other wonders current in Tahiti the men of Aitutaki
prayed to their gods to send the Tut&euml; to their island with axes and nails
and <i>pupuhi</i>, and this, according to an old priest, was their prayer.
"O great Tangaroa, send your large ship to our land: let us see the
Cookees. Great Tangiia, send us a dead sea, send us a propitious gale,
to bring the far-famed Cookees to our land, to give us nails and iron
and axes; let us see these outriggerless canoes." And with the feast
presented with the prayer were promises of greater feasts so soon as
their prayer was answered. The gods heard them. A few months later
the Cookees came. The great ship did not anchor, but one of the natives
took his courage in both hands, and went off in his canoe. He brought
back strange tales of what he had seen. It was a floating island; there
were two rivers flowing on it (the pumps), and two plantations in which
grew taro and sugar-cane and bread-fruit, and the keel scraped the
bottom of the sea, for he dived as deep as he could go without finding it.
</p><p>
Williams has fallen into two errors in his account (<a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>). In the same
breath he claims for himself the discovery of Rarotonga, in 1823, and
announces this to have been a visit of the <i>Bounty</i> after she was taken
by the mutineers, <i>i.e.</i> in April, 1789. Rarotonga was, in fact, discovered
by the ship <i>Seringapatam</i> in 1814, though Williams may have
been the first to land. The tradition must have referred to Bligh's visit
to Aitutaki before the mutiny when the decks were encumbered with
bread-fruit, for we know that the first thing the mutineers did after
setting their captain adrift was to throw all the bread-fruit plants overboard,
and that they steered direct for Tahiti.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42-1" id="Footnote_42-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42-1"><span class="label">[42-1]</span></a> Discovered by Cook in his second voyage. There are nine small
islands connected by a reef, covered with trees, but destitute of water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43-1" id="Footnote_43-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43-1"><span class="label">[43-1]</span></a> Sufficient for thirty days at most. In the face of the danger of parting
company, with the <i>Pandora</i> overloaded with stores, and the tender
too feebly manned to wait at so dangerous a rendezvous as the Friendly
Islands, Edwards showed very little foresight in neglecting to provision
the tender for an independent voyage. His neglect nearly cost the crew
their lives.</p></div>

Ojatava, and Opoloo by different navigators, who may have taken the
names of villages or districts to mean the whole island. The population

came on that afternoon, and lasted all the following day, prevented
him from approaching it, and from seeing Savaii, which he would have
seen on May 7th in clear weather. La P&eacute;rouse coasted along its southern
shore on December 17th, 1789. Unfortunately, smarting from the
massacre of de Langle and his boat's crew at Tutuila, he was in no mood
for communicating with the natives, and he did not anchor.</p></div>

and the offerings to which he was entitled, gave him considerable
influence. The complicated hierarchy of spiritual chiefs in Tonga was
a continual puzzle to Cook. Fatafehi at this time was an ornamental
personage, inferior in dignity to the Tui Tonga, and in power to Tukuaho,
who wielded the authority of his father Mumui, the Tui Kanakubolu.
The Toobou (Tubou) mentioned here was the deputy of the tyrant
Tukuaho, who, eight years later, was to pay the penalty of his crimes
in the Revolution of 1799. Hamilton mentions that the tradition of
Tasman's visit in 1642 was still preserved.</p></div>

recognized some of those who attacked Bligh's boat four days after the
mutiny, and murdered Quartermaster Norton, but solicitude for the
crew of the tender, which might call there, prevented Edwards from
punishing them as they deserved. No doubt, both at Tofoa and
Namuka, the natives would have attempted to take the ship had they
thought success possible as, we now know, they had planned to capture
Cook's ships, and as they actually did capture the privateer <i>Port-au-Prince</i>
in 1806 at Haapai. In 1808 William Mariner, one of the survivors
of that ill-fated ship, who has left behind him the best account of a
native race that exists probably in any language, was led by the strange
native account of Norton's murder, to visit his grave. The natives
asserted that Norton was killed by a carpenter for the sake of an axe
which he was carrying; that his body was stripped and dragged some
distance inland to a <i>Malae</i> where it lay exposed for three days before
burial; and that the grass had never since grown upon the track of the
body nor upon its resting-place on the <i>Malae</i>. Mariner found a bare
track leading inland from the beach and terminating in a bare patch,
lying transversely, about the length and breadth of a man. It did not
appear to be a beaten path, nor were there people enough in the neighbourhood
to make such a path. Probably it was an old track, long
disused and forgotten, for by such natural causes is man's belief in the
supernatural fed.</p></div>

in command, discovered Pangopango harbour while on a walk through
the island, but neither Bougainville nor La P&eacute;rouse seems to have discerned
the masked fissure in the cliff which forms its entrance. Edwards
must have had a copy of Bougainville on board, but no record of La
P&eacute;rouse's visit four years before, or he would have shown greater
caution in communicating with the natives. That he had heard something
of La P&eacute;rouse's voyage, and had some ground for suspicion is
shown by Hamilton. A detailed account of de Langle's murder is to
be found in "La P&eacute;rouse's Voyage," vol. ii.</p></div>

of Captain Cook's visit in 1777. On April 21st, 1799, he conspired
against Tukuaho, the temporal sovereign of Tonga and assassinated
him, plunging Tonga into a civil anarchy which lasted twenty years.
He was Mariner's patron and protector until his death in 1809. "The
great master of Greek drama," says a writer in the "Quarterly Review,"
"could have desired no better elements than are to be found in the
history of this remarkable man; his remorseless ambition and his
natural affections&mdash;his contempt for the fables and ceremonies of his
country when in prosperity&mdash;his patient submission to them when in
distress&mdash;his strong intellects&mdash;his evil deeds&mdash;and the death which
was believed to be inflicted on him in vengeance by the over-ruling

though he did not visit them, gives all their native names in his list
of the islands composing the Friendly or Tonga Group. The honour of
their discovery belongs to the Spanish pilot Maurelle, who sailed from
Manila in 1781, without proper charts or instruments and almost
without provisions for his long voyage to America. Reduced to
desperate straits by famine, he sighted Fonua Lei, the northernmost
of the Tonga Group, which he called Margoura, believing it to be one of
the Solomon Islands. At Vavau he was liberally entertained by Bau
or Poulaho, the Tui Tonga of Cook's visit four years before. La P&eacute;rouse
passed close to the islands in December, 1787, but, consistent with his
determination to hold no further intercourse with natives after the
murder of M. de Langle, did not enter the harbour of Neiafu. Edwards
had no account of either of these voyages. La P&eacute;rouse's journals were
not published until 1797.
</p><p>
Fonua Lei was again destroyed by an eruption in 1846. The inhabitants
who had plantations on it were removed to Vavau just in time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59-1" id="Footnote_59-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59-1"><span class="label">[59-1]</span></a> There is only one. It was so named by Tasman 1642. Maurelle
called it Sola. But Edwards probably mistook the twin islets of Hunga
Tonga and Hunga Haapai for Pylstaart.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62-1" id="Footnote_62-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62-1"><span class="label">[62-1]</span></a> Niua-fo'ou (New Niua), discovered by W. Cornelis Schouten in the
Dutch ship <i>Eendracht</i> (Unity) on May 14th, 1616, and named by him
"Good Hope" Island. Twelve canoes came off, and some of them
attempted to take the boat that he had sent ashore for water, but
desisted on discharge of a volley which killed two men. He wrote:
"The island was full of black cliffs, green on the top, and black, and
was full of coco-trees and black earth. There was a large village,
and several other houses on the seashore: the land was undulating,
but not very high." No ship is known to have visited the island from
1614 to this visit in 1791.
</p><p>
The cocoanuts grown here are the largest in the world, but the
specimens planted in other islands do not appear to maintain their
abnormal size. The island is further remarkable from the fact that the
Megapodius, or Scrub hen, is plentiful there, and nowhere else in the
Pacific further east than the New Hebrides. The natives have no
traditions of its introduction. The eggs have been prized as a delicacy
in Tonga for centuries, and are exported thither by every canoe going
southward during the breeding season. It is said that they are sometimes
hatched artificially, but the young <i>malao</i> does not take kindly
to the bush in Tonga, although the vegetation is much the same.
Why should the bird be found in Polynesia, having skipped all the
intermediate islands of Melanesia? To what story of the migration
of races is it the only clue?</p></div>

a fashion that the natives frequently attempt to escape from the island
as stowaways.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65-1" id="Footnote_65-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65-1"><span class="label">[65-1]</span></a> This confirms the story of Kau Moala, a Tongan navigator, who
returned to his native land in 1807 and related his adventures to
Mariner. He had visited Futuna, Rotuma and Fiji in a double canoe,
and, in describing Rotuma, he related the legend of two giants who had
migrated from Tonga to Rotuma in legendary times. He was shown
gigantic bones in proof of the story, the bones, no doubt, of some
marine monster. Mention is made of Rotuma in a Tongan saga of the
early sixteenth century, and there can be no doubt that there was
occasional intercourse between these distant islands during the period
when the Tongans were the Norsemen of the Pacific.
</p><p>
Kau Moala heard nothing of Edwards' visit, though he brought
news of the visit of a ship to Futuna, and of an ineffectual attempt to
take her&mdash;perhaps the visit of Schouten, whose account of the affray
tallies closely with theirs even to the killing of six natives. The tradition
was still fresh after 190 years. Edwards' visit, having brought no
disasters on the natives, escaped the attention of the native poets and
was forgotten.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68-1" id="Footnote_68-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68-1"><span class="label">[68-1]</span></a> This was Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz Group. It was probably seen
by Menda&ntilde;a in 1595, and again by Carteret in 1767, but the interest
attached to it by Europeans, and particularly to Edwards' visit, lies
in the undoubted fact that at that very time there were survivors of
La P&eacute;rouse's ill-fated expedition upon it. If his search for the mutineers
had been as keen at this part of his voyage as it was in the earlier
portion, he would have been the means of rescuing them. The smoke
he saw may well have been signal fires lighted by the castaways to
attract his attention.
</p><p>
La P&eacute;rouse's ships were cast away in 1788, just three years before,
shortly after the Commander had delivered his journals to Governor
Phillip in Botany Bay for transmission to Europe. Their fate was
unknown until Peter Dillon chanced upon a French swordhilt in Tucopia
thirty-eight years later in 1826. Satisfying himself that they had
been brought from Vanikoro, he persuaded the East India Company
to place him in command of a search expedition. In 1827 he made a
thorough examination of the island, and found the remains of the
<i>Boussole</i>; the <i><ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Astrotabe'">Astrolabe</ins></i>, according to the native account, having
foundered in deep water. He found the clearing where the survivors
had felled timber to build themselves a brig in which they sailed to meet
a second shipwreck elsewhere, perhaps on the Great Barrier reef of
Queensland. But two had been left, and of these one had died shortly
before his visit, and the other had gone with the natives to another
island leaving no trace behind him.
</p><p>
D'Entrecasteaux, when in search of La P&eacute;rouse in 1793, also passed
within sight of the castaways.
</p><p>
D'Urville made a thorough examination of the island both in 1828
and 1838. The relics brought home by Dillon may be seen in the
Gallerie de la Marine in the Louvre.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_69-1" id="Footnote_69-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69-1"><span class="label">[69-1]</span></a> This was the dangerous reef now known as Indispensable Reef,
after the ship <i>Indispensable</i> commanded by Captain Wilkinson, who
discovered it in 1790.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_69-2" id="Footnote_69-2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69-2"><span class="label">[69-2]</span></a> It was, in fact, the mainland of New Guinea. The land East of Cape
Rodney, comprising Orangerie, Table, and Cloudy Bays, lies so low
and is so generally obscured with haze that on a dull day Edwards
would not have seen it.
</p><p>
It is doubtful whether Edwards' Capes Rodney and Hood, are
correctly placed in the modern charts. Our Cape Rodney is not a
conspicuous headland, and it lies half a degree eastward of 212&middot;14 W.
Longitude, and 9&#8242; South of 10<sup>6</sup>&middot;3&deg; S. Latitude. Edwards' positions are
usually so accurate that I cannot see why they should have been
departed from. Our Cape Hood, on the other hand, is exactly in the
position of his Cape Rodney, and is besides a very conspicuous wooded
tongue of land. Beyond is another conspicuous point. Round Head,
which corresponds in position with Edwards' Cape Hood. Mount
Clarence, moreover, would not appear to lie between Capes Rodney and
Hood until the former was out of sight astern. I think that Mount
Clarence must have been hidden by clouds, and that Edwards' Mount
Clarence was in reality the high cone in the Saroa district, which is a
conspicuous feature on the coast line. A further indication that the
day was hazy lies in the fact that Edwards did not see the great Owen
Stanley Range which towers up 13,000 feet behind. Had he done so
he would not have mistaken the mainland for a group of scattered
islands. Hamilton does not call Mount Clarence an "island," but a
"mountain." A further proof that Edwards' "Cape Hood" was
Round Head is found in the remark "After passing Cape Hood the
land appears lower, and to branch off about N.N.W., . . . for we saw
no other land." This applies to Round Head, and to no other part of
the coast.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_70-1" id="Footnote_70-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70-1"><span class="label">[70-1]</span></a> If he had kept this course he would have struck the New Guinea

Passage, which, while not free from obstructions to the westward, would
have admitted him to a safe anchorage at the Murray Islands, inside
the Barrier Reef.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_71-2" id="Footnote_71-2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71-2"><span class="label">[71-2]</span></a> It was an unfortunate choice. Had he steered north on first
encountering the reefs he would have made the coast which he might
have followed in safety, as Bligh did in his boat voyage after the
mutiny, by what is now known as the Great North-East Channel.
He was led Southward by his plan of using the Endeavour Straits.
See Hamilton's account, <a href="#Page_141">pp. 141-2</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73-1" id="Footnote_73-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73-1"><span class="label">[73-1]</span></a> Two men were crushed to death; one by a gun that had broken
loose, and the other by a falling spar. The whole ship's company
seems to have behaved splendidly, working at the pumps and at the
sail they were preparing to haul under the ship's bottom until they
could scarcely stand for fatigue, with nothing to replenish their strength
but "a cask of excellent strong ale which we brewed at Anamooka"
(Hamilton).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73-2" id="Footnote_73-2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73-2"><span class="label">[73-2]</span></a> Every reader must be struck by the fact that in his description
of this disaster, Edwards never once speaks of the prisoners. Hamilton,
it is true, does say "The prisoners were ordered to be let out of irons,"
but another account, ascribed to Lieutenant Corner, second lieutenant
of the <i>Pandora</i>, throws a sinister light on this part of the narrative.
"Three of the <i>Bounty's</i> people, Coleman, Norman, and M'Intosh, were
now let out of irons, and sent to work at the pumps. The others offered
their assistance, and begged to be allowed a chance of saving their
lives; instead of which, two additional sentinels were placed over
them, with orders to shoot any who should attempt to get rid of their
fetters. Seeing no prospect of escape, they betook themselves to prayer,
and prepared to meet their fate, everyone expecting that the ship would
soon go to pieces, her rudder and part of the sternpost being already
beat away. No notice was taken of the prisoners, as is falsely stated
by the author of the 'Pandora's Voyage,' although Captain Edwards
was entreated by Mr. Heywood to have mercy upon them, when he
passed over their prison to make his own escape, the ship then lying on
her broadside, with the larboard bow completely under water. Fortunately
the master-at-arms, either by accident or design, when slipping
from the roof of 'Pandora's Box' into the sea, let the keys of the
irons fall through the scuttle or entrance, which he had just before
opened, and thus enabled them to commence their own liberation, in
which they were generously assisted, at the imminent risk of his own
life, by William Moulter, a boatswain's mate who clung to the coamings,
and pulled the long bars through the shackles, saying he would set
them free, or go to the bottom with them. Scarcely was this effected
when the ship went down. The master-at-arms and all the sentinels
sunk to rise no more. Among the drowned were Mr. Stewart, John
Sumner, Richard Skinner, and Henry Hillbrandt, the whole of whom
perished with their hands still in manacles."
</p><p>
Some allowance is to be made both for the confusion of a shipwreck,
and for the natural fear of the commander that in the loosening of the
ties of authority natural to such a moment, the liberation among his
crew of a number of men who had already mutinied successfully, and
were going home with a rope about their necks, would be an act of
merciful folly. This, however, does not excuse him for refusing his
prisoners the shelter of an old sail on the sand cay, and so obliging them
to get shelter from the sun by burying themselves neck-deep in the
sand, as Heywood afterwards stated. Heywood further asserted that
after the vessel struck the prisoners, having wrenched themselves out
of their irons, implored Edwards to let them out of "Pandora's Box,"
but that he had them all ironed again.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74-1" id="Footnote_74-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74-1"><span class="label">[74-1]</span></a> In his evidence before the court-martial Edwards said: "The

by evaporation, but found that the absorption through the skin
tainted the fluids of the body with salt so that the saliva became intolerable
in the mouth. The young bore the want of water better than
the old, but all alike became excessively irritable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_80-1" id="Footnote_80-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80-1"><span class="label">[80-1]</span></a> This hospitality was not extended to the prisoners, who were
confined in irons in the castle, and fed on bad provisions. But on the
passage to Batavia in the <i>Rembang</i> they had worse in store, for the ship
was partially dismasted in a cyclone, and would certainly have gone
ashore but for the exertions of the English passengers. The prisoners
took their turn at the pumps with the rest, and when their strength
gave out, they were put in irons and allowed to rest upon a wet sail
soaked with the drainings of a pig-stye under which it was spread.
At Batavia Edwards distributed the purchase-money of the tender
among his people to enable them to buy clothes, and the prisoners,
having their hands at liberty, made suits and hats for the <i>Pandora's</i>
crew, and so were able to buy clothes of their own.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">By George Hamilton, Surgeon of the <i>Pandora</i>.</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Government</span> having resolved to bring to punishment
the mutineers of His Majesty's late ship <i>Bounty</i>, and to
survey the Straits of Endeavour, to facilitate a passage to
Botany Bay, on the 10th of August 1790, appointed
Captain Edward Edwards to put in commission at
Chatham, and take command of the <i>Pandora</i> Frigate
of twenty-four guns, and a hundred and sixty men.</p>

<p>A great naval armament then equipping retarded our
progress, and prevented that particular attention to the
choice of men which their Lordships so much wished;
as contagion here crept amongst us from infected clothing,
the fatal effects of which we discovered, and severely
experienced, in the commencement of the voyage.</p>

<p>Every thing necessary being completed, and an additional
complement of naval stores, received for the refitment
of the <i>Bounty</i>; dropped down to Sheerness, saluted
Admiral Dalrymple, payed the same compliments to
Sir Richard King, in passing the Downs, arrived at
Portsmouth, and found there Lord Howe with the Union
Flag at the main, and the proudest navy that ever graced
the British seas under his command.</p>

<p>Here the officers and men received six months pay in
advance, and after receiving their final orders, got the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
time-keeper on board, weighed anchor, and proceeded
to sea.</p>

<p>As the white cliffs of Albion receded from our view
alternate hopes and fears took possession of our minds,
wafting the last kind adieu to our native soil.</p>

<p>We pursued our voyage with a favourable breeze;
but <i>Pandora</i> now seemed inclined to shed her baneful
influence among us, and a malignant fever threatened
much havoc, as in a few days thirty-five men were confined
to their beds, and unfortunately Mr. Innes, the
Surgeon's only mate, was among the first taken ill;
what rendered our situation still more distressing, was
the crowded state of the ship being filled to the hatchways
with stores and provisions, for, like weevils, we
had to eat a hole in our bread, before we had a place to
lay down in; every officer's cabin, the Captain's not
excepted, being filled with provisions and stores. Our
sufferings were much encreased, for want of room to
accommodate our sick, notwithstanding every effort of
the Captain that humanity could suggest.</p>

<p>In this sickly lumbered state, near the latitude of
Madeira, we observed a sail bearing down upon us:
from her appearance and man&oelig;uvres, we had every
reason to believe she was a ship of war; and a rumour
of a Spanish war prevailing when we left England, rendered
it necessary to clear ship for action; as soon as our
guns were run out, and all hands at quarters, got along
side of her, when she proved His Majesty's Ship, <i>Shark</i>,
sent out with orders of recall to Admiral Cornish, who had
sailed for the West Indies a few days before we left
Spithead.</p>

<p>This little disaster deranged us much, having at the
same time bad weather, attended with heavy thunder
squals. The Peek of Teneriff now began to shew his
venerable crest, towering above the clouds; and in two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
days more came to an anchor in the road of Santa Cruz,
but did not salute, as the Commandant had not authority
to return it.</p>

<p>Immediately on our arrival we were boarded by the
Port-master, by whom we learnt they had been in much
apprehension of a disagreeable visit from the English,
but were happy to hear that matters were amicably
settled between the Courts of Madrid and St. James's.</p>

<p>With respect to site nothing can be more beautifully
picturesque than the town of Santa Cruz. It stands in
the centre of a spacious bay, on a gentle acclivity surrounded
with retiring hills, and the noble promontory
of the Peek rising majestically behind it, dignifies the
scene beyond description, being continually diversified
with every vicissitude of the surrounding atmosphere,
emerging and retiring thro' the fleecy clouds, from the
bottom of the mountain to its summit.</p>

<p>All the circumjacent hills on the margin of the beach
are tufted with little forts, and barbett batteries, forming
an Esplanade round the bay, affords a most agreeable
landscape. The houses being all painted white, pretty
regularly built, and standing on a rising ground, raises
one street above another, and heightens the scene from
the water; to which the Governor's garden contributes
much to beautify the town.</p>

<p>In the centre of the principal square, is a well built
fountain, continually playing, which, in a warm climate,
has a desirable cooling effect. There is but one church,
which contains a few indifferent paintings.</p>

<p>The inhabitants are civil, but reserved, and the inquisition
being on the island, spreads a gloomy distrust on
the countenance of the people.</p>

<p>The troops are miserably cloathed, and poverty and
superstition lord it wide. The wines of this place, from
a late improvement in the vines, are equal to the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
kind of Madeira, and I cannot pass over this subject
without making honourable mention of the candour of
Mr. Rooney our wine merchant.</p>

<p>Here we completed our water from an acqueduct
admirably constructed for the convenience of the shipping,
and after receiving on board lemons, oranges, pomegranates,
and bananas, with every variety of fruits and
other refreshments with which this island most plentifully
abounds, proceeded again on our voyage.</p>

<p>The fever that prevailed on our leaving England
became now pretty general, and almost every man had it
in turn, and as we approached the line many of the
convalescents had a relapse, but the Lords of the Admirality,
previous to our sailing, had supplied us with such
unbounded liberality in every thing necessary for the
preservation of the seamens' health, that I may venture
to say many lives were saved from their bounty, and I
should be wanting in my duty to their Lordships, as well
as the community, was I to pass over in silence the uncommon
good effects we experienced from supplying the
sick and convalescent with tea and sugar; this being the
first time it has ever been introduced into his Majesty's
service; but it is an article in life that has crept into
such universal use, in all orders of society, that it needs no
comment of mine to recommend it. It may, however,
be easily conceived that it will be sought with more
avidity by those whose aliment consists chiefly in animal
food, and that always salt, and often of the worst kind.
Their bread too is generally mixed with oatmeal, and of
a hot drying nature. Scarcity of water is a calamity to
which seafaring people are always subject; and it is
an established fact, that a pint of tea will satiate thirst
more than a quart of water. But when sickness takes
place, a loathing of all animal food follows; then tea
becomes their sole existence, and that which can be con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>veyed
to them as natural food will be taken with pleasure,
when any slip slop, given as drink, will be rejected with
disgust. Suffice it to say, that Quarter-masters, and real
good seamen have ever been observed to be regular in
cooking their little pot of tea or coffee, and in America
seamen going long voyages, always make it an article in
their agreement to be supplied with tea and sugar.</p>

<p>The air now becoming intolerably hot, and to evacuate
the foul air from below where the people slept, had
recourse to Mr. White's new ventilator, but found little
benefit from it; not from any fault in the machine, but
from the crowded state of the ship, it was impossible
to throw a current of air into those places where it was
most wanted, but by the addition of a flexible leather tube,
like a water engine, it might be rendered of the utmost
importance to the service, as in tenders' press-holds, and
in line-of-battle ships at sea, when the lower deck ports
cannot be opened; where often the jail fever, and all the
calamities that attend human nature in crowded situations,
are engendered, that might be entirely obviated
by Mr. White's ingenious machine. I should beg to
recommend wheels to be substituted for legs to it, for its
easier conveyance from one part of the ship to the other,
and that he would sacrifice beauty to strength, as a
slight mahogany jim crack is not well calculated to the
severity of heat we are exposed to, in climates where it is
most wanted.</p>

<p>There were now many water spouts about the ship,
at which we fired several guns: the thermometer fluctuated
between seventy-nine and eighty, and without any
thing worthy of remark, in the common occurrence of
things at sea, on the twenty-eight of December saw the
land of the Brazils, and in two days saluted the fort at
Rio Janiero with fifteen guns, which was immediately
returned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
On our coming to anchor, an officer came to acquaint
the Captain, that a party of soldiers should be sent on
board of us, agreeable to their custom, which was most
peremptorily denied as inadmissable with the dignity of
the British flag, nor would Captain Edwards go on shore
to pay his respects to the Vice Roy, till that etiquete
was settled, that his boat should not be boarded.</p>

<p>After the usual compliments were paid the Vice Roy,
his suit of carriages were ordered to attend the British
officers, and Monsieur le Font, the Surgeon-General,
who spoke English with ease and fluency, shewed us every
mark of politeness and attention on the occasion, in
carrying us through the principal streets, then visited the
public gardens, built by the late Vice Roy, and laid out
with much taste and expence. All the extremity of the
garden is a fine terrace which commands a view of the
water, and is frequented by people of fashion, as their
Grand Mall: at each end of the terrace there is an
octagonal built room, superbly furnished, where merendas<a name="FNanchor_96-1" id="FNanchor_96-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_96-1" class="fnanchor">[96-1]</a>
are sometimes given. On the pannels are painted the
various productions and commerce of South America,
representing the diamond fishery, the process of the
indigo trade. The rice grounds and harvest, sugar
plantation, South Sea whale fishery, &amp;c. these were
interspersed with views of the country, and the quadrupedes
that inhabit those parts. The ceilings contained
all the variety, the one of the fish, the other of the fowl
of that continent. The copartments of the ceiling of
the one room was enriched in shell work, with all the
variegated shells of that country, and in the copartments
are delineated all the variety of fish that the coast of
South America produces. The other copartment is
enriched with feathers and so inimitably blended as to
produce the happiest effect. In this ceiling is painted all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>
the birds and fowls of the country, in all their splendid
elegance of plumage. The sofas and furniture are rich
in the extreme: and in this elegant recess, an idle traveller
may have an agreeable lounge, and at one view comprehend
the whole natural history of this vast continent.
In the centre of the terrace there is a Jet d'eau, in form
of a large palm-tree, made of copper, which at pleasure
may be made to spout water from the extremity of all
the leaves. This tree stands on a well disposed grotto,
which rises from the gravel walk below to the level of
the terrace, and terminates the view of the principal walk.
Near the foot of the grotto two large aligators, made of
copper, are continually discharging water into a handsome
bason of white marble, filled with gold and silver fishes.</p>

<p>There are fine orangeries, and lofty covered arbours
in different parts of the garden, capable of containing a
thousand people. Here the cyprian nymphs hold their
nocturnal revels; but intrigue is attended with great
danger, as the stilletto is in general use, and assassination
frequent, the men being of a jealous sanguinary
turn, and the women fond of gallantry, who never appear
in public unveiled. When <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Bouganvile'">Bougainville</ins>, the French circumnavigator
called here, his chaplain was assassinated in
an affray of that kind; but since that accident, orders
were given that a commissioned officer should attend
all foreign officers, and a soldier the privates; and all
strangers, on landing, are conducted to the main guard
for their escort. This answers a double purpose, as they
are much afraid of strangers smuggling or carrying money
out of the country, under the mask of personal protection,
every motion is watched and scrutinized, nor can you
purchase any thing of a merchant, till he has settled with
the officer of the police how much he shall exact for his
goods; so you have always the satisfaction of being rob'd
as the act directs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
The trade of this country is much cramped by the
improper policy of the mother country; for although
it abounds with every thing that the earth produces,
wealth is far from being diffusive, and a spirit for revolt
seems to prevail amongst them; but they were rather
premature in business, a conspiracy being detected
whilst we were there, many of the first people in the
country thrown into dungeons, a strong guard put over
them, and all intercourse denied them. But in order to
check that spirit of rebellion among the colonists, a
regiment of black slaves is now embodied, who will
be very ready to bear arms against their oppressive
masters; but should a revolution in South America take
place, which sooner or later must eventually happen,
some of our South Sea discoveries would then prove an
advantageous situation for a little British colony.</p>

<p>All public works are done here by slaves in chains, who
perform a kind of plaintive melancholy dirge in recitative,
to sooth their unavailing toil, which, with the accompanyment
of the clanking of their irons, is the real voice of
wo, and attunes the soul to sympathy and compassion,
more than the most elaborate piece of music.</p>

<p>The troops are remarkably well cloathed, and in fine
order, both infantry and cavalry; the horses are small,
but spirited, and tournaments frequently performed as
the favourite amusement of the inhabitants, at which
the cavaliers display a wonderful share of address.</p>

<p>The town is large, built of stone, and the streets very
regular; there are several handsome churches, monasteries,
and nunneries, and contains about forty thousand
inhabitants; but, like the old town of Edinburgh, each
floor contains a distinct family, and of course liable to the
same inconveniencies, cleanliness being none of its most
shining virtues.</p>

<p>The officers of the army shewed us uncommon kindness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
and made us some presents of red bird skins for the
savages we were going amongst.</p>

<p>I cannot, in words, bestow sufficient panegyric on the
laudable exertions of my worthy messmates, Lieutenants
Corner and Hayward, for their unremitting zeal in procuring
and nursing such plants as might be useful at
Otaheitee or the islands we might discover.</p>

<p>We now took leave of our friends here, and it was
with some regret, as it was bidding adieu to civilized life,
for a very undetermined space of time. Lieutenant
Hayward having finished his astronomical observations
on shore, came on board with the time-keeper and instruments,
and again proceeded on our voyage, on the morning
of January 8<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '.'">,</ins> 1791. In running down the coast of the
Brazils, saw several spermac&aelig;ti whales, and vessels
employed on that fishery. Could it have been accomplished
in the month of January, it was intended to take in a
supply of water at New-Year's harbour, but the season
was too far advanced. The weather now became cold,
and the health of the people mended apace: passed by
the straits of Magellan, and on the 31st of January saw
Cape St. Juan, Staten Island, and New-Year's Island.
The thermometer was at 48 degrees. We were fortunate
enough to weather the tempestuous regions of Cape
Horn, without any thing remarkable happening, although
late in the season.</p>

<p>The weather, as we advanced, became now exceedingly
pleasant, and the many good things with which we were
supplied, began to have a wonderful good effect on the
strength of our convalescents. I here beg the reader's
indulgence for a small digression on the health of the
seamen, as it is a subject of much national importance,
and those voyages the only test of what is found to
succeed best, my duty leads me to the attempt, however
unequal to the task:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
It may be remarked, the sour Crout kept during the
voyage, in the highest perfection, and was often eat as a
sallad with vinegar, in preference to recent, cut vegetables
from the shore. A cask of this grand antiscorbutic was
kept open for the crew to eat as much of as they pleased;
and I will venture to affirm, that it will answer every
purpose that can be expected from the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>The Essence of Malt afforded a most delightful beverage,
and, with the addition of a little hops, in the warmest
climates, made as good strong beer as we could in England.
We were likewise supplied with malt in grain, but should
prefer the essence, as it is less liable to decay, and stows
in much less room, which is a very valuable consideration
in long voyages.</p>

<p>Cocoa we found great benefit from; it is much relished
by the men, stows in little room, and affords great
nourishment. At the close of the war in 1783, in the
West Indies, men that had been the whole war on salt
provisions, from a liberal use of the cocoa, got fat and
strong, and in the <i>Agamemnon</i> we had five hundred men
who had served most of the war on salt provisions; but
after the cocoa was introduced, we had not a sick man on
board till the day she was paid off. Indeed it is the only
article of nourishment in sea victualling; for what can
in reason be expected from beef or pork after it has been
salted a year or two?</p>

<p>Wheat we found answer extremely well, rough ground
in a mill occasionally as we wanted it, and with the
addition of a little brown sugar, it made a pleasant
nourishing diet, of which the men were extremely fond.
Another great advantage attending it, that it does not
require half the quantity of water that pease do.</p>

<p>Soft bread was found extremely beneficial to the sick
and convalescent, and we availed ourselves of every
opportunity of baking for half the complement at a time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
As the flour keeps so much longer sound than biscuit,
it may be needless to remark its superior advantages;
besides, it is not liable to be damaged by water or otherwise,
so much as bread, as a crust forms outside, which
protects the rest. In point of stowage it likewise is
preferable.</p>

<p>As the fate of every expedition of this kind depends
much on the exertion of the subordinate departments
of office, the thanks of every individual in the <i>Pandora</i>
is due to Mr. Cherry, for his uncommon attention to the
victualling.</p>

<p>The dividing the people into three watches had a double
good effect as it gave them longer time to sleep, and dry
themselves before they turned in; and as most of our
crew consisted of landsmen, the fewer people being on
deck at a time, rendered it necessary to exert themselves
more in learning their duty.</p>

<p>The air became now temperate, mild, and agreeable;
but unfortunately we sprung a leak in the after part of
the ship, which reached the bread room, and damaged
much of it, as one thousand five hundred and fifteen
pounds were thrown over-board, and a great deal much
injured, that we kept for feeding the cattle. Many blue
Peterals were seen flying about, and on the 4th of March
saw Easter Island. We now set the forge to work, and the
armourers were busily employed in making knives and
iron work to trade with the savages. On the 16th we
discovered a Lagoon Island of about three or four miles
extent; it was well wooded, but had no inhabitants,
and was named Ducie's Island, in honour of Lord
Ducie.</p>

<p>On the 17th we discovered another Island, about five
or six miles long, with a great many trees on it, but was
not inhabited: this was called Lord Hood's Island.</p>

<p>On the 19th we discovered an Island of the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
description as the former, which was named Carrisfort
Island, in honour of Lord Carrisfort.</p>

<p>On the 22nd passed Maitea, and on the morning of the
23rd of March anchored in Matavy bay, in the Island of
<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Otaheety'">Otaheitee</ins>. In the dawn of the morning, a native immediately
on seeing us, paddled off in his canoe, and came on
board, who shewed expressions of joy to a degree of madness,
on embracing and saluting us, by whom we learnt
that several of the mutineers were on the island; but that
Mr. Christian and nine men had left Otaheitee long since
in the <i>Bounty</i>, and amused the natives, by telling them
Captain Bligh had gone to settle at Whytutakee, and that
Captain Cook was living there. Language cannot express
his surprise on Lieutenant Hayward's being introduced
to him, who had been purposely concealed.</p>

<p>At eleven in the forenoon the Launch and Pinnance
was dispatched with Lieutenants Corner and Hayward
and twenty-six men, to the north west part of the island,
in quest of mutineers. Immediately on our arrival,
Joseph Coleman, the armourer of the <i>Bounty</i>, came on
board, and a little after the two midshipmen belonging to
the <i>Bounty</i>; at three Richard Skinner came off, and on
the 25th the boats returned, after chasing the mutineers
on shore, and taking possession of their boat. As they had
taken to the heights, and claimed the protection of Tamarrah,
a great chief in Papara, who was the proper king of
Otaheitee, the present family of Ottoo being usurpers,
and who intended, had we not arrived with the assistance
of the <i>Bounty's</i> people, to have disputed the point with
Ottoo.</p>

<p>On the twenty-seventh we sent the Pinnace with a
present of a bottle of rum to king Ottoo, who was with his
two queens at Tiaraboo, requesting the honour of his
company, but the bottle of rum removed all scruples,
and next day the royal family paid us a visit, and in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>
suit came Oedidy, a chief particularly noticed by Captain
Cook.</p>

<p>On the first visit they make it a point of honour of
accepting of no present; but they make sufficient amends
for that, by introducing a numerous train of dependents
afterwards, to obtain presents.</p>

<p>The King is a tall handsome looking man, about six
feet three inches high, good natured, and affable in his
manners. His principal queen, Edea, is a robust looking,
course woman, about thirty, and was extremely solicitous
in learning and adopting our customs, and on hearing
our English ladies drank tea, became very fond of it.
The other queen, or concubine, named <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Alredy'">Aeredy</ins>, is a pretty
young creature, about sixteen years of age: they all three
sleep together, and live in the most perfect harmony.</p>

<p>A detachment of men were immediately ordered,
under the command of Lieutenant Corner, to march
across the country, and if possible to get between the
mountains and the mutineers; this gentleman was extremely
well calculated for an expedition of this kind,
having, in the early part of his life, bore a commission in
the land service, and next morning they landed on Point
Venus, attended by the principal chiefs as conductors,
and a number of the common people to assist in carrying
the ammunition over the heights: what rendered their
assistance more necessary, was their having to cross a
rapid cataract, or river, which came down from the
mountains, and formed so many curves. They had to
ford it sixteen times in the course of their journey, which
gave evident proofs of the superior strength of the natives
over the English seamen. The former went over with
ease, where the sailors could not stem the rapidity of the
torrent without their help. They were, however, forced
to send to the ship for ropes and tackles to gain some
heights which were otherwise inaccessible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
On the party coming to a rest, the Lieutenant expressed
a wish to one of the natives for something to eat, who told
him he might be supplied with plenty of victuals ready
dressed; he immediately ran to a temple, or place of
worship, where meat was regularly served to their god,
and came running with a roasted pig, that had been
presented that day. This striking instance of impiety
rather startled the Lieutenant, which the other easily
got over, by saying there was more left than the god
could eat.</p>

<p>It was with much difficulty they could restrain the
natives from committing depredations on the Cava
grounds of the upper districts, as they were on the eve
of a war with them respecting the hereditary right of
the crown.</p>

<p>The party now arrived at the residence of a great
chief, who received them with much hospitality and
kindness; and after refreshing them with plenty of meat
and drink, carried the officer to visit the Morai of the dead
chief, his father. Mr. Corner judging it necessary, by
every mark of attention, to gain the good graces of this
great man, ordered his party to draw up, and fire three
vollies over the deceased, who was brought out in his
best new cloaths, on the occasion; but the burning
cartridge from one of the muskets, unfortunately set fire
to the paper cloaths of the dead chief. This unlucky
disaster threw the son into the greatest perplexity, as
agreeable to their laws, should the corpse of his father
be stolen away, or otherwise destroyed, he forfeits his
title and estate, and it descends to the next heir.</p>

<p>There was at the same time a party embarked by water,
under the command of Lieutenant Hayward, who took
with him some of the principal chiefs, amongst whom was
Oedidy, before mentioned by Captain Cook, who went a
voyage with him, but fell into disrepute amongst them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
from affirming he had seen water in a solid form; alluding
to the ice. He also took with him one Brown, an Englishman,
that had been left on shore by an American vessel
that had called there, for being troublesome on board:
but otherwise a keen, penetrating, active fellow, who
rendered many eminent services, both in this expedition
and the subsequent part of the voyage. He had lived
upwards of twelve months amongst the natives, adopted
perfectly their manners and customs, even to the eating
of raw fish, and dipping his roast pork into a cocoa nut
shell of salt water, according to their manner, as substitute
for salt. He likewise avoided all intercourse
and communication with the <i>Bounty's</i> people, by which
means necessity forced him to gain a pretty competent
knowledge of their language; and from natural complexion
was much darker than any of the natives.</p>

<p>Captain Edwards had taken every possible means of
gaining the friendship of Tamarrah, the great prince of
the upper district, by sending him very liberal presents,
which effectually brought him over to our interest. The
mutineers were now cut off from every hope of resource;
the natives were harrassing them behind, and Mr. Hayward
and his party advancing in front; under cover of
night they had taken shelter in a hut in the woods, but
were discovered by Brown, who creeping up to the place
where they were asleep, distinguished them from the
natives by feeling their toes; as people unaccustomed to
wear shoes are easily discovered from the spread of their
toes. Next day Mr. Hayward attacked them, but they
grounded their arms without opposition; their hands were
bound behind their back and sent down to the boat under
a strong guard.</p>

<p>During the whole business there was only two natives
killed; one was shot in the dusk of the evening, two nights
before the people surrendered, by one of the centinels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
who had his musket twice beat out of his hand from the
natives pelting our party with large stones; but the
instant he was shot, some of his friends rushed in and
carried off the corpse.</p>

<p>The other native was shot by the mutineers; when
attacked by the natives they took to a river; a stone
being thrown by one of the natives at the wife, or woman,
of one of the mutineers, enraged him so much, that he
immediately shot the offender.</p>

<p>A prison was built for their accommodation on the
quarter deck, that they might be secure, and apart from
our ship's company; and that it might have every
advantage of a free circulation of air, which rendered it
the most desirable place in the ship. Orders were likewise
given that they should be victualled, in every respect
in the same as the ship's company, both in meat, liquor,
and all the extra indulgencies with which we were so
liberally supplied, notwithstanding the established laws
of the service, which restricts prisoners to two-thirds
allowance: but Captain Edwards very humanely commiserated
with their unhappy and inevitable length of
confinement. Oripai, the king's brother, a discerning,
sensible, and intelligent chief, discovered a conspiracy
amongst the natives on shore to cut our cables should it
come to blow hard from the sea. This was more to be
dreaded, as many of the prisoners were married to the most
respectable chiefs' daughters in the district opposite to
where we lay at anchor; in particular one, who took the
name of Stewart, a man of great possession in landed
property, near Matavy Bay: a gentleman of that name
belonging to the <i>Bounty</i> having married his daughter,
and he, as his friend and father-in law, agreeable to their
custom, took his name.</p>

<p>Ottoo the king, his two brothers, and all the principal
chiefs, appeared extremely anxious for our safety; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>
after the prisoners were on board, kept watch during the
night; were always keeping a sharp look out upon our
cables, and continually spurring the centinels to be careful
in their duty. The prisoners' wives visited the ship daily
and brought their children, who were permitted to be
carried to their unhappy fathers. To see the poor captives
in irons, weeping over their tender offspring, was too
moving a scene for any feeling heart. Their wives
brought them ample supplies of every delicacy that the
country afforded while we lay there, and behaved with the
greatest fidelity and affection to them.</p>

<p>Next day the king, his two queens, and retinue, came on
board to pay us a formal visit, preceded by a band of
music. The ladies had about sixty or seventy yards of
Otaheitee cloth wrapt round them, and were so bulky
and <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unweildy'">unwieldy</ins> with it, they were obliged to be hoisted on
board like horn cattle: hogs, cocoa-nuts, bananas, a
rich sort of peach, and a variety of ready dressed puddings
and victuals, composed their present to the Captain.</p>

<p>As soon as they were on board, the Captain debarassoit
the ladies, by rolling their linen round his middle; an
indispensable ceremony here in receiving a present of cloth:
and Medua, wife to Oripai, the king's brother, took a
great liking to the Captain's laced coat, which he immediately
put on her with much gallantry; and that beautiful
princess seemed much elated with her new finery. I
cannot ommit a circumstance of this lady's attachment
to dress. There was a custom which had prevailed for
a long time, to present the god with all red feathers that
could be procured; but thinking she would become
red feathers full as well as his godship, immediately
employed all her domestics making them up into fly
flaps, and other personal ornaments, to prevent the altar
making a monopoly of all the good things, in this, as
well as in other countries.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
A grand H&aelig;va was next day ordered for our entertainment
ashore, on Point Venus, and on our landing we were
preceded by a band of music, and led to where the king
and his levee were in waiting to receive us. The course
was soon cleared by the chiefs, and the entertainment
began by two men, who vied with each other in filthy
lascivious attitudes, and frightful distortions of their
mouths. These having performed their part, two ladies,
pretty fancifully dressed, as described in Captain Cook's
Voyages, were introduced after a little ceremony. Something
resembling a turkey-cock's tail, and stuck on their
rumps in a fan kind of fashion, about five feet in diameter,
had a very good effect while the ladies kept their faces
to us; but when in a bending attitude, they presented
their rumps, to shew the wonderful agility of their loins;
the effect is better conceived than described. After
half an hour's hard exercise, the dear creatures had rem&uuml;&eacute;
themselves into a perfect fureur, and the piece concluded
by the ladies exposing that which is better felt than seen;
and, in that state of nature, walked from the bottom of
the theatre to the top where we were sitting on the grass,
till they approached just by us, and then we complimented
them in bowing, with all the honours of war.</p>

<p>These accomplishments are so much prized amongst
them that girls come from the interior parts of the
country to the court residence, for improvement in the
H&aelig;va, just as country gentlemen send their daughters to
London boarding-schools.</p>

<p>This may well be called the Cytheria of the southern
hemisphere, not only from the beauty and elegance of
the women, but their being so deeply versed in, and so
passionately fond of the Eleusinian mysteries; and
what poetic fiction has painted of Eden, or Arcadia, is
here realized, where the earth without tillage produces
both food and cloathing, the trees loaded with the richest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
of fruit, the carpet of nature spread with the most odoriferous
flowers, and the fair ones ever willing to fill your
arms with love.</p>

<p>It affords a happy instance of contradicting an opinion
propagated by philosophers of a less bountiful soil, who
maintain that every virtuous or charitable act a man
commits, is from selfish and interrested views. Here
human nature appears in more amiable colours, and the
soul of man, free from the gripping hand of want, acts
with a liberality and bounty that does honour to his
God.</p>

<p>A native of this country divides every thing in common
with his friend, and the extent of the word friend, by
them, is only bounded by the universe, and was he reduced
to his last morsel of bread, he cheerfully halves it with
him; the next that comes has the same claim, if he wants
it, and so in succession to the last mouthful he has. Rank
makes no distinction in hospitality; for the king and
beggar relieve each other in common.</p>

<p>The English are allowed by the rest of the world, and I
believe with some degree of justice, to be a generous,
charitable people; but the Otaheiteans could not help
bestowing the most contemptuous word in their language
upon us, which is, Peery Peery, or Stingy.</p>

<p>In becoming the Tyo, or friend of a man, it is expected
you pay him a compliment, by cherishing his wife; but,
being ignorant of that ceremony, I very innocently gave
high offence to Matuara, the king of York Island, to whom
I was introduced as his friend: a shyness took place on
the side of his Majesty, from my neglect to his wife; but,
through the medium of Brown the interpreter, he put
me in mind of my duty, and on my promising my endeavours,
matters were for that time made up. It was to
me, however, a very serious inauguration: I was, in the
first place, not a young man, and had been on shore a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
whole week; the lady was a woman of rank, being
sister to Ottoo, the king of Otaheitee, and had in her
youth been beautiful, and named Peggy Ottoo. She is
the right hand dancing figure so elegantly delineated in
Cook's Voyages. But Peggy had seen much service, and
bore away many honourable scars in the fields of Venus.
However, his Majesty's service must be done, and Matuara
and I were again friends. He was a domesticated man,
and passionately fond of his wife and children; but now
became pensive and melancholy, dreading the child should
be Piebald; though the lady was six months advanced in
her pregnancy before we came to the island.</p>

<p>The force of friendship amongst those good creatures,
will be more fully understood from the following circumstance:
Churchhill, the principal ringleader of the
mutineers, on his landing, became the Tyo, or friend, of
a great chief in the upper districts. Some time after the
chief happening to die without issue, his title and estate,
agreeable to their law from Tyoship, devolved on Churchhill,
who having some dispute with one Thomson of the
<i>Bounty</i>, was shot by him. The natives immediately rose,
and revenged the death of Churchhill their chief, by
killing Thomson, whose skull was afterwards shown to us,
which bore evident marks of fracture.</p>

<p>Oedidy, although perfectly devoted to our interest,
on being appointed one of the guides in the expedition
against the mutineers, expressed great horror at the act
he was going to commit, in betraying his friend, being Tyo
to one of them.</p>

<p>They are much less addicted to thieving than when
Capt. Cook visited them; and when things were stolen,
by applying to the magistrate of the district, the goods
were immediately returned; for, like every other well
regulated police, the thief and justice were of one gang.</p>

<p>Sometimes we slightly punished the offenders, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
cutting off their hair. A beautiful young creature, who
lived at the Observatory with one of our young gentlemen,
slipped out of bed from him in the night, and stole all his
linen. She was punished for the theft, by shaving one
of her eye-brows, and half of the hair off her head. She
immediately run into the woods, and used to come once
or twice a day to the tent, to request looking at herself
in the glass; but the grotesque figure she cut, with one
side entirely bald, made her shriek out, and run into the
woods to shun society.</p>

<p>With respect to agriculture, in a soil where nature has
done so much, little is left to human industry; but had
there been occasion for it, abilities would not be wanting.
It is much to be lamented, that the endeavours of the
philanthropic Sir Joseph Banks were frustrated, by their
razing of every thing which he took so much pains to rear
amongst them, a few shaddocks excepted. Tobacco
and cotton have escaped their ravage; and they are
much mortified that they cannot eradicate it from their
grounds: but were a handloom on a simple construction,
as used by the natives of Java, introduced amongst
them, they could soon turn their cotton to good account.
An instance of their ingenuity and imitative powers in
matting, was a thing perfectly unknown amongst them till
Captain Cook introduced it from Anamooka, one of the
Friendly Isles: but in that branch of manufacture they
now far surpass their original. They have likewise
abundance of fine sugarcanes, growing spontaneously
all over the island, from which rum and sugar might be
extracted. Indeed an attempt was made by Coleman, the
armourer of the <i>Bounty</i>, who made a still, and succeeded;
but, dreading the effects of intoxication, both amongst
themselves and the natives, very wisely put an end to
his labours by breaking the still.</p>

<p>Captain Bligh has likewise planted Indian corn, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
which much may be expected. On our landing, as soon
as public business of more importance would permit,
our gentlemen were indefatigable in laying out a piece of
garden ground, and ditching it round. Lemons, oranges,
limes, pine-apples, plants of the coffee tree, with all the
lesser class of things, as onions, lettuces, peas, cabbages,
and every thing necessary for culinary purposes, were
planted.</p>

<p>In order that they might not meet the same fate of
the things planted by Sir Joseph Banks, Captain Edwards
made use of every stratagem to make the chiefs fond of
the oranges and limes, by dipping them in sugar, to cover
the acid before it be presented to them to eat. Messrs.
Corner and Hayward were equally zealous in using the
most persuasive arguments with the chiefs to take care
of our garden, and rear and propagate the plants when we
were gone; to all which they lent a deaf ear, and treated
the subject with much levity, saying, they might be very
good to us, but that they were already plentifully supplied
with every thing they wished or wanted, and had not
occasion for more. But on the Lieutenant's representing,
that if, on our return, they could supply us with plenty of
such articles as we left with them, they in exchange would
receive hatchets, knives, and red cloth, they seemed more
favourably inclined to our project; and I have no doubt
but that some after navigators will reap the benefit of
their industry.</p>

<p>The Bread-fruit, although the most delicate and nourishing
food upon earth, is, with people like them, liable to
inconveniencies; for in such a group or Archipelago of
islands, whose inhabitants are in such various gradations
of refinement, from the gentle and polished Otaheitean,
to the savage and cannibal Feegee, a war amongst them is
often attended with devastation as well as famine. By
cutting round the bark of the Bread-fruit tree, a whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
country may be laid waste for four or five years, young
trees not bearing in less time. Crops, such as Indian corn,
English wheat and peas, that have been left amongst them,
can in time of war be stored in granaries on the top of their
almost inaccessible mountains.</p>

<p>While speaking of the Bread-fruit tree, I can exemplify
my subject from what happened to an island contiguous
to Otaheite, whose coast abounded with fine fish; and
the Otaheitans, being themselves too lazy to catch them,
destroyed all the Bread-fruit trees on this little island; by
which act of policy, they are obliged to send over boats
with fish regularly to market, to be supplied with bread
in barter from Otaheite. To this island they likewise
send their wives, thinking they become fair by living on
fish, and low diet. They also send boys for the same
reason, whom they keep for abominable purposes.</p>

<p>As to the religion of this country, it is difficult for me
to define it. Their tenets, although equally ignorant of
heathen mythology or theological intricacies, seem to
partake of both; and, like other nations in the early
ages of society, are rendered subservient to political
purposes, as by the machinery of deification the person
of the king is sacred and inviolable. Notwithstanding
the king be a broad shouldered strapping fellow, three
sturdy stallions of <i>cecisbeos</i>, or lords in waiting, are kept
for the particular amusement of the queen, when his
majesty is in his cups. Yet the royal issue is always
declared to be sprung from the immortal Gods; and the
heir-apparent, during his minority, is put under the tuition
of the high priest. Their God is supposed to be omnipresent,
and is worshipped in spirit, idolatry not being
known amongst them. The sacred mysteries are only
known to the priests or augurs, the king, princes, and great
chiefs, the common people only serving as victims, or to
fill up the pageantry of a religious procession. One of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
our gentlemen expressing a wish to the high priest, of
carrying from amongst them that God whose altars
craved so much human blood, he, like a true priest, had
his subterfuge ready, by saying, there were more of the
same family in the other islands, from whence they could
easily be supplied. On all great occasions, each district
sends a male victim; and the island containing forty
districts, it may be presumed the mortality is great.
Between the sacrifices and the ravages of war, a preponderating
number of females must have taken place;
to counteract which, a law passed, that every other
female child should be put to death at birth; and the
husband always officiating as acoucheur to his wife, the
child is destroyed as soon as the sex is discovered.</p>

<p>The absurdity of this inhuman law is now pretty
evident. Women are become more scarce, and set a
higher value on their charms, which occasions many
desperate battles amongst them. Some with fractured
skulls were sent on board of us, which had been got in
amorous affrays of that kind.</p>

<p>It may naturally be supposed, that people of such
gentle natures make no conspicuous figure in the theatre
of war.</p>

<p>Their war-canoes are very large, on which a platform is
placed, capable of containing from a hundred and fifty
to two hundred men. But their taste in decorating the
prow of their men of war, plainly indicates they are more
versed in the fields of Venus than Mars, every man of
war having a figure head of the god Priapus, with a preposterous
insignia of his order; the sight of which never
fails to excite great glee and good humour amongst the
ladies.</p>

<p>It is customary with those nations at war, that the
treaty of peace be confirmed by the conquerors sending a
certain number of their women to cohabit with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
nation that is vanquished, in order to conciliate their
affection by a bond more lasting than wax and parchment.
It was the unhappy lot of Otaheite to be overcome by a
nation whose women were too masculine for them;
they being accustomed to the amorous dalliance of their
own beautiful females, were averse to familiar intercourse
with strangers. The ladies returned with all the rage
of disappointed women, and the war was renewed with
all its horrors.</p>

<p>They are well acquainted with the bow and arrow, but
use it as an amusement. The only missive weapons
they use are the sling and spear. They have now amongst
them about twenty stand of arms, and two hundred
rounds of powder and ball. They can take a musket to
pieces, and put it up again; are good marksmen, take
proper care of their arms and ammunition; and are
highly sensible of the superior advantage it gives them over
the neighbouring nations.</p>

<p>In the preparing and printing their cloth, the women
display a great share of ingenuity and good taste. Many
of their figures were exactly the patterns which prevailed,
as fashionable, when we left England, both striped and
figured. They print their figured cloth by dipping the
leaves in dye-stuffs of different colours, placing them as
their fancy directs. Their cloth is of different texture
of fineness, from a stuff of the same nature in quality
as the slightest India paper, to a kind as durable as some
of our cottons; but they will not bear water, and of course
become troublesome and expensive. They are generally
made up in bales, running about two yards broad, and
twenty or thirty yards long. We had some thousands of
yards of it sent on board as presents.</p>

<p>Their sumptuary laws, at first sight, may appear
severe towards the fair sex, who are not permitted to eat
butchermeat, nor to eat at all, in the presence of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
husbands. It certainly does not convey the most delicate
ideas, to a mind impressed with much sensibility, to see a
fine woman devouring a piece of beef; and those voluptuaries,
who may be said to exist only by their women,
would naturally endeavour to remove the possibility of
presupposing a disgusting idea in that object in which all
their happiness centres.</p>

<p>Every woman, the queen and royal family excepted,
on the approach of the king, is denuded down to the waist,
and continues so whilst his majesty is in sight. Should
the king enter a woman's house, it is immediately pulled
down. The king is never permitted to help himself with
meat or drink, which makes him a very troublesome
visitor, as he is never quiet whilst a bottle is in sight till
he has had the last drop of it.</p>

<p>Their houses are well adapted to the temperate climate
they inhabit, and generally consist of three chambers,
the interior one of which the chief retires to, after he has
drank his cava. A profound silence is observed during his
repose; for should they be suddenly awaked, it produces
violent vomiting, and a train of uneasy sensations; but,
otherwise, if undisturbed, it proves a safe anodyne, creates
amorous dreams, and a powerful excitement to venery.
In the adjoining chamber, his fair spouse waits, with
eager expectation, to avail herself of the happy moment
when her lord should awake, which is by slow degrees;
and he is roused from Elysium, by her gentle offices, in
tenderly embracing every part of his body, until his ideal
scenes of bliss are realised; and when fully sated with the
luscious banquet, they retire to the bath, to gather fresh
vigour for a renewal of similar joys. In this mazy round
of chaste dissipation, the hours glide gently on, and the
evening is spent in dancing to the music of Pan's pipes,
the flute, and h&aelig;va drum. They then go to the bath
again, and the festivity of the evening is concluded with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
a repast of fruit, and young cocoanut milk. The whole
village indiscriminately join the feast; and the demon of
rank and precedence, with their appendages malevolence
and envy, has never yet disturbed their happy board.</p>

<p>Happy would it have been for those people had they
never been visited by Europeans; for, to our shame be
it spoken, disease and gunpowder is all the benefit they
have ever received from us, in return for their hospitality
and kindness. The ravages of the venereal disease is
evident, from the mutilated objects so frequent amongst
them, where death has not thrown a charitable veil over
their misery, by putting a period to their existence.</p>

<p>A disease of the consumptive kind has of late made
great havoc amongst them; this they call the British
disease, as they have only had it since their intercourse
with the English.</p>

<p>In this complaint they are avoided by society, from a
supposition of its being contagious; and in every old out-house,
you will find miserable objects, for want of medical
assistance, abandoned to their wretched fate. From what
we could learn, it generally terminates fatally in ten or
twelve months; but I am led to believe, that in many cases
it originates from the venereal disease.<a name="FNanchor_117-1" id="FNanchor_117-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_117-1" class="fnanchor">[117-1]</a></p>

<p>The voice of humanity honour, and justice, calls upon
us as a nation to remedy those evils, by sending some
intelligent surgeon to live amongst them. They at
present pant for the pruning-hand of civilization and the
arts; love and adore us as beings of a superior nature, but
gently upbraid us with having left them in the same
abject state they were at first discovered.</p>

<p>We had buoyed many of them up with the hopes of
carrying them to England with us, in order to secure their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
fidelity and honesty, especially those who were most
useful in our domestic concerns; but on explaining to
them that even bread was not to be obtained in England
without labour, they lost hopes of their favourite voyage.</p>

<p>Large presents were now brought us for our sea-store;
and notwithstanding Mr. Bentham our purser having
most liberally supplied the ship with four pounds of fresh
pork per man each day, it made no apparent scarcity;
beside salting some thousand weight, and a prodigious
number of goats, fowls, and other things. Could we have
made it convenient to have staid another week, some cows
were promised to have been sent us from a neighbouring
island. Capt. Cook had left with them a horse and mare,
a cow with calf, and a bull; but, from some mistake,
they killed a horse instead of one of the cows, and found it
very tough, disagreeable eating, by which means they were
disgusted with all the horned cattle, and drew an unfavourable
conclusion that their meat was all of the same
texture. Had some pains been taken with them, to get
the better of a dislike they have to milk, and explained to
them how variously it might be employed as food, I
have no doubt but they would have paid more attention to
the horned cattle. They used to persist in saying that
milk was urine; but on pointing to a woman that was
suckling her child, and pushing their own argument,
they seemed convinced of their error. We have left them
a goose and a gander, which they take a great delight in.</p>

<p>Edea, the Queen, endeavoured to conquer that absurd
dislike, and at last became fond of milk in her tea.</p>

<p>A painting of Capt. Cook, done in oil by Webber, which
had been delivered to Capt. Edwards on his first landing,
was now returned to them. It is held by them in the
greatest veneration; and I should not be surprised if,
one day or other, divine honours should be paid to it.
They still believe Capt. Cook is living; and their seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
Mr. Bentham our purser, whom they perfectly recollected
as having been the voyage with him, and spoke their
language, will confirm them in that opinion.</p>

<p>The harbour was surveyed by Mr. Geo. Passmore, the
master, an able and experienced officer.</p>

<p>Our officers here, as at Rio Janeiro, showed the most
manly and philanthropic disposition, by giving up their
cabins, and sacrificing every comfort and convenience
for the good of mankind, in accommodating boxes with
plants of the Bread-fruit tree, that the laudable intentions
of government might not be frustrated from the loss of
his majesty's ship <i>Bounty</i>.</p>

<p>We had now completed our water from an excellent
spring, out of a rock close to the water's edge, at Offaree.</p>

<p>King Ottoo, and his queen Edea, came on board,
and were very importunate in their solicitations to Capt.
Edwards, requesting him to take them to England with
him. Aeredy, the concubine, likewise requested the same
favour; but she more generously begged they might all
three go together. But Oripai, and the other chiefs,
remonstrated against his going, as they were on the eve
of a war.</p>

<p>We were now perfectly ready for sea; and as Capt.
Cook's picture is presented to all strangers, it is customary
for navigators to write their observations on the back of
it; so our arrival and departure was notified upon it.</p>

<p>The ship was filled with cocoa-nuts and fruit, as many
pigs, goats, and fowls, as the decks and boats would hold.
The dismal day of our departure now arrived. This I
believe was the first time that an Englishman got up his
anchor, at the remotest part of the globe, with a heavy
heart, to go home to his own country. Every canoe
almost in the island was hovering round the ship; and
they began to mourn, as is customary for the death of a
near relation. They bared their bodies, cut their heads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
with shells, and smeared their breasts and shoulders with
the warm blood, as it streamed down; and as the blood
ceased flowing, they renewed the wounds in their head,
attended with a dismal yell.</p>

<p>Ottoo now took leave of us; and, with the tears
trickling down his cheeks, begged to be remembered to
King George. The tender was put in commission, and the
command of her given to Mr. Oliver the master's mate,
Mr. Renouard a midshipman, James Dodds a quartermaster;
and six privates were put on board of her.
She was decked, beautifully built, and the size of a
Gravesend boat.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II"></a>CHAP. II.</h2>

<h3>VOYAGE FROM OTAHEITE TO ANAMOOKA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a pleasant breeze, on the evening of the 8th of May,
passed Emea or York Island, contiguous to, and in sight
of Otaheite. It is governed by Matuara, brother-in-law
to Ottoo. It is a pleasant romantic looking spot, with
very high hills upon it, and about twelve miles in circumference.
They were lately attacked by some neighbouring
power, and Matuara requested the lend of a
musket from his friend and ally. When peace was restored,
Ottoo sent for his musket. Matuara represented,
that as a man, from a sense of honour, he wished to return
it; but that as a king, the love he bore his subjects
prevented him complying with the request. That single
musket, and a few cartridges, gives him no small degree
of consequence, and are retained as the royal dower of
his wife.</p>

<p>Next morning we reached Huaheine, and sent the boats
on shore in Owharre Bay. As Oedidy the chief requested
to go with us to Whytutakee, he went on shore with the
officers, in their search for intelligence of the mutineers;
but they returned without success.</p>

<p>Here we learned the fate of Omai, the native of Otaheite,
whom Captain Cook brought from England. On his
return here he had wealth enough to obtain every fine
woman on the island; and at last fell a martyr to Venus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
having finished his career by the venereal disease, two
years after his landing. His house and garden are still
standing; but his musket occasioned a war after his
death, and was found in the possession of a native of
Ulitea. His servant was on board of us, but had not
retained a single article of his property.</p>

<p>On the 10th, we examined Ulitea and Otaha, interchanged
presents with the natives, and landed in
Chamanen's Bay; but got no information.</p>

<p>We examined Bolobola on the 11th; and Tatahu, the
king, honoured us with a visit. The people of this island
are of a more warlike disposition than any other of the
Society Islands; and on account of that national ferocity
of character, are much caressed by the Otaheitans and
neighbouring islands. They are sensible of their pre-eminence,
and boast of their country, in whatever island
you meet them. They are tatooed in a particular manner;
and whether they may have spread their conquests, or
other nations imitated them, I could not learn; but a
prodigious number, in islands we afterwards visited, were
tatooed in their fashion. What was most singular, we
saw some with the glans of the penis entirely tatooed;
and our men, from being tatooed in the legs, arms, and
breast, places of much less sensation, were often lame
for a week, from the excruciating torture of the operation.
Tatahu likewise informed us there were no white men on
Tubai, a small island to the northward of Bolobola, and
under his jurisdiction; nor upon Mauruah, another
island in sight, and to the westward of Bolobola. He also
mentioned another island, which he called Mopehah.
Here Oedidy went on shore; but getting drunk in meeting
some of his old friends, he fell asleep, and lost his passage.
On the 12th we left Mauruah, and on the 13th lost sight
of the Society Islands.</p>

<p>Here one of the prisoners begged to speak with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
Captain, and gave information of Mr. Christian's intended
rout.</p>

<p>We now shaped our course to fall in to the eastward of
Whytutakee, an island discovered by Capt. Bligh, and
on the 19th made the island. We sent the boat on shore,
covered by the tender, to examine it; but found it a
thing impossible for the <i>Bounty</i> to have been there; and
the natives said they had seen no white people. They
were very shy, and we could not coax them on board. One
of them recollected having seen Lieut. Hayward on board
the <i>Bounty</i>. Here we purchased from the natives a
spear of most exquisite workmanship. It was nine feet
long, and cut in the form of a Gothic spire, all its ornaments
being executed in a kind of alto relievo; which, from the
slow progress they made with stone tools, must have been
the labour of a man's whole life.</p>

<p>Here nature begins to assume a ruder aspect; and the
silken bands of love gives way to the rustic garniture of
war. The natives of either sex wear no cloathing, but a
girdle of stained leaves round their middle, and the men
a gorget, of the exact shape and size as at present wore
by officers in our service. It is made of the pearl oyster-shell.
The centre is black, and the transparent part of
the shell is left as an edge or border to it, which gives it a
very fine effect. It is slung round their neck with a band
of human hair, or the fibres of cocoa nut-shell, of admirable
texture, and a rose worked at each corner of the gorget,
the same as the military jemmy of the present day.</p>

<p>We now began to discover, that the ladies of Otaheite
had left us many warm tokens of their affection.</p>

<p>Instructions were given to the commander of the tender
to be particular in guarding against surprise, and a
rendezvous established, in case of separation; and on
Sunday, the 22nd of May, made Palmerston's Islands.</p>

<p>The tender's signal was made to cover the boats in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
landing; and some natives were seen rowing across the
lagoon to a considerable distance. Soon after their
landing, Lieut. Corner and his party discovered a yard
and some spars marked <i>Bounty</i>, and the broad arrow upon
them. When this intelligence was communicated to the
ship, a signal was made to the party on shore to advance
with great circumspection, and to guard against surprise.
Mr. Rickards, the master's mate, went in the cutter, and
made a circuit of the island.</p>

<p>Lieuts. Corner and Hayward landed on the different
isles with cork-jackets; but the surf running very high
all round, rendered it exceedingly dangerous, and in
many places impracticable. Had they not been expert
swimmers, in duty of this kind, they must have certainly
been drowned, as they had not only themselves and the
party to take care of, but the arms and ammunition to
land dry.</p>

<p>About four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Sival the midshipman
came on board in the jolly-boat, and brought
with him several very curious stained canoes, representing
the figure of men, fishes, and beasts. He had committed
some mistake in the orders he was sent to execute, and was
ordered to return immediately to rectify it; but the boat
did not come back again. A few minutes after she left
the ship, the weather became thick and hazy, and began to
blow fresh; so that, even with the assistance of glasses,
they could not see whether she made the shore or not. It
continued to blow during the night, so as to prevent the
party on shore from coming on board. They had been
employed during the day in searching all the islands with
particular attention, having every reason to suspect the
mutineers were there, from finding the <i>Bounty's</i> yard and
spars. But at last, wore out with fatigue in marching,
and swimming through so many reefs, and having no
victuals the whole day, in the evening they began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>
forage for something to eat. The gigantic cockle was the
only thing that presented. Of the shell of one they made
a kettle, to boil some junks of it in. (It may be necessary
here to remark, for the information of those who are not
acquainted with it, that there are some of them larger
than three men can carry.) Of this coarse fare, and some
cocoa-nuts, they made shift, with the assistance of a
good appetite, to make a tolerable hearty supper; they
then set the watch, and went to sleep. They had thrown
a large nut on the fire before they lay down, and forgot
it; but in the middle of the night, the milk of the cocoa-nut
became so expanded with the heat, that it burst with a
great explosion. Their minds had been so much engaged
in the course of the day with the enterprise they were
employed in, expecting muskets to be fired at them from
every bush, that they all jumped up, seized their arms,
and were some time before they could undeceive themselves
that they were really not attacked.</p>

<p>In the morning the boats returned; and we were much
concerned to hear that they had seen nothing of the jolly-boat.
The tender received a fresh supply of provisions
and ammunition; at the same time they had orders to
cruise in a certain direction, to look for the jolly-boat;
and Palmerston's Isles was appointed as a rendezvous
to meet again. Lieut. Corner now came on board, in a
canoe not much bigger than a butcher's tray. The cutter
was sent a second time to search the reefs, but returned
without success. We then run down with the ship in
the direction the wind had blown the preceding day, in
hopes of finding the boat; but after a whole day's run to
leeward, and working up again by traverses to the isles,
saw nothing of her. The tender hove in sight in the evening,
and we again searched the isles without success. All
further hopes of seeing her were given up, and we proceeded
on our voyage. It may be difficult to surmise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
what has been the fate of these unfortunate men. They
had a piece of salt-beef thrown into the boat to them on
leaving the ship; and it rained a good deal that night and
the following day, which might satiate their thirst. It is
by these accidents the Divine Ruler of the universe has
peopled the southern hemisphere.<a name="FNanchor_126-1" id="FNanchor_126-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_126-1" class="fnanchor">[126-1]</a></p>

<p>Here are innumerable islands in perpetual growth.
The coral, a marine vegetable, with which the South Seas
in every part abounds, is continually shooting up from
the bottom to the surface, which at first forms lagoon
islands; and the water in the centre is evaporated by
the heat of the sun, till at last a terra firma is completed.
In this state it would for ever remain a barren sand, had
not Divine Providence given birth to the cocoa-nut tree,
whose fruit is so protected with a hard shell, that after
floating about for a twelve-month in the sea, it will
vegetate, take root, and grow in those salt marshes,
lagoons, incipient islands, or what you please to call them.
Their roots serve to bind the surface of the coral; and
the annual shedding of their leaves, in time creates a
soil which produces a verdure or undergrowth. This
affords a favourite resting-place to sea-fowls, and the
whole feathered race, who in their dung drop the seeds of
shrubs, fruits, and plants; by which means all the variety
of the vegetable kingdom is disseminated. At last the
variegated landscape rises to the view; and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
divine Architect has finished his work, it becomes then a
residence for man.</p>

<p>From the various accidents incident to man in the early
stages of society, their wants, and the restless spirit
inherent in their natures, they are tempted to dare
the elements, either in fishing, commerce, or war; and
from their temerity are often blown to remote and uninhabited
islands. Distressing accidents of this nature
often happening to inhabitants of the South Seas, they
now seldom undertake any hazardous enterprise by water
without a woman, and a sow with pig, being in the canoe
with them; by which means, if they are cast on any of
those uninhabited islands, they fix their abode.</p>

<p>Their remote situation from European powers has
deprived them of the culture of civilised life, as they
neither serve to swell the ambitious views of conquest,
nor the avarice of commerce. Here the sacred finger of
Omnipotence has interposed, and rendered our vices the
instruments of virtue; and although that unfortunate
man Christian has, in a rash unguarded moment, been
tempted to swerve from his duty to his king and country,
as he is in other respects of an amiable character and
respectable abilities, should he elude the hand of justice,
it may be hoped he will employ his talents in humanizing
the rude savages; so that, at some future period, a
British Ilion may blaze forth in the south with all the
characteristic virtues of the English nation, and complete
the great prophecy, by propagating the Christian knowledge
amongst the infidels. As Christian has taken fourteen
beautiful women with him from Otaheite, there is
little doubt of his intention of colonising some undiscovered
island.</p>

<p>On the 6th day of June, we discovered an island, which
was named the Duke of York's island. Lieuts. Corner
and Hayward were sent out to examine it in the two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
yauls, covered by the tender. Some huts being discovered
by the ship, a signal was immediately made for the party
on shore to be on their guard, and to advance with caution.</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival on shore, a ship's wooden buoy
was discovered. On searching the huts, nets of different
sizes were found hanging in them, and a variety of fishing
utensils. Stages and wharfs were likewise discovered
in different parts of the creek, which led us to imagine it
was only an island resorted to in the fishing season by
some neighbouring nation. The skeleton of a very large
fish, supposed to be a whale, was found near the beach;
and a place of venerable aspect, formed entirely by the
hand of Nature, and resembling a Druidical temple,
commanded their attention. The falling of a very large
old tree, formed an arch, through which the interior
part of the temple was seen, which heightened the perspective,
and gave a romantic solemn dignity to the scene.
At the extreme end of the temple, three altars were placed,
the centre one higher than the other two, on which some
white shells were piled in regular order.<a name="FNanchor_128-1" id="FNanchor_128-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_128-1" class="fnanchor">[128-1]</a></p>

<p>After traversing the island, they returned to the huts,
and hung up a few knives, looking-glasses, and some little
articles of European manufacture, that the natives, on
their return, might know the island had been visited.</p>

<p>On the 12th, we discovered another island, which was
named the Duke of Clarence's island. In running along
the land, we saw several canoes crossing the lagoons. The
tender's signal was made, to cover the boats in landing,
and Lieuts. Corner and Hayward sent to reconnoitre the
beach, to discover a landing-place. In this duty they came
pretty near some of the natives in their canoes, who made
signs of peace to them; but, either from fear or business,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
avoided having any intercourse with us. Morais, or
burying-places, were likewise found here, which indicated
it to be a principal residence. Here they find
some old cocoa trees hollowed longitudinally, as tanks
or reservoirs for the rain water.</p>

<p>On the 18th, we discovered an island of more considerable
extent than any island that has hitherto been discovered
in the south; and as there were many collateral
circumstances which might hereafter promise it to be a
discovery of national importance, in honour of the first
lord of the admiralty, it was called Chatham's Island.
It is beautifully diversified with hills and dales, of twice
the extent of Otaheite, and a hardy warlike race of people.
The natives described a large river to us, which disembogued
itself into a spacious bay, that promises
excellent anchorage.<a name="FNanchor_129-1" id="FNanchor_129-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_129-1" class="fnanchor">[129-1]</a> Here we learned the death of
Fenow, king of Anamooka, from one of his family of the
same name, who had a finger cut off in mourning for him.
After trading a whole day with the natives, who seemed
fair and honourable in their dealings, we examined it
without success, and proceeded on our voyage.</p>

<p>On the 21st we discovered a very considerable island,
of about forty miles long. It was named by the natives
Otutuelah. Capt. Edwards gave no name to it; but
should posterity derive the advantages from it which it
at present promises, I presume it may hereafter be called
Edwards's island.<a name="FNanchor_129-2" id="FNanchor_129-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_129-2" class="fnanchor">[129-2]</a></p>

<p>It is well wooded with immense large trees, whose foliage
spreads like the oak; and there is a deal of shrubbery
on it, bearing a yellow flower. The natives are remarkably
handsome. Some of them had their skins tinged
with yellow, as a mark of distinction, which at first led
us to imagine they were diseased. Neither sex wear any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>
cloathing but a girdle of leaves round their middle,
stained with different colours. The women adorn their
hair with chaplets of sweet-smelling flowers and bracelets,
and necklaces of flowers round their wrists and neck.</p>

<p>On their first coming on board, they trembled for fear.
They were perfectly ignorant of fire-arms, never having
seen a European ship before. They made many gestures
of submission, and were struck with wonder and surprise
at every thing they saw. Amongst other things, they
brought us some most remarkable fine puddings, which
abounded with aromatic spiceries, that excelled in taste
and flavour the most delicate seed-cake. As we have
never hitherto known of spices or aromatics being in
the South Seas, it is certainly a matter worthy the investigation
of some future circumnavigators. We traded with
them the whole day, and got many curiosities. Birds
and fowls, of the most splendid plumage, were brought on
board, some resembling the peacock, and a great variety
of the parrot kind.</p>

<p>One woman amongst many others came on board.
She was six feet high, of exquisite beauty, and exact
symmetry, being naked, and unconscious of her being so,
added a lustre to her charms; for, in the words of the
poet, "She needed not the foreign ornaments of dress;
careless of beauty, she was beauty's self."</p>

<p>Many mouths were watering for her; but Capt. Edwards,
with great humanity and prudence, had given previous
orders, that no woman should be permitted to go below,
as our health had not quite recovered the shock it received
at Otaheite; and the lady was obliged to be contented
with viewing the great cabin, where she was shewn the
wonders of the Lord on the face of the mighty deep.
Before evening, the women went all on shore, and the
men began to be troublesome and pilfering. The third
lieutenant had a new coat stole out of his cabin; and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
were making off with every bit of iron they could lay
hands on.</p>

<p>It now came on to blow fresh, and we were obliged
to make off from the land. Those who were engaged in
trade on board were so anxious, that we had got almost
out of sight of their canoes before they perceived the ship's
motion, when they all jumped into the water like a flock
of wild geese; but one fellow, more earnest than the
rest, hung by the rudder chains for a mile or two, thinking
to detain her.</p>

<p>This evening, at five o'clock, we unfortunately parted
company, and lost sight of our tender. False fires were
burnt, and great guns and small arms were fired without
success, as it came on thick blowing weather.</p>

<p>We cruised for her all the 23rd and 24th, near where we
parted company, which was off a piece of remarkable
high land. What was most unfortunate, water and
provisions were then on deck for her, which were intended
to have been put on board of her in the morning. She
had the day before received orders, in case of separation,
to rendezvous at Anamooka, and to wait there for us. A
small cag of salt, and another of nails and iron-ware,
were likewise put on board of her, to traffic with the
Indians, and the latitudes and longitudes of the places
we would touch at, in our intended rout. She had a boarding
netting fixed, to prevent her being boarded, and several
seven-barrelled pieces and blunderbusses put on board
of her.</p>

<p>As we proceeded to the eastward, we saw another
island, which we knew to be one of the navigator's isles,
discovered by Mons. Bougainville. On the 28th, in the
morning, saw the Happai Islands, discovered by Capt.
Cook, and before noon, the group of islands to the eastward
of Anamooka, and sailed down between Little
Anamooka and the <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Falafagee'">Fallafagee</ins> Island.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
On the 29th, we anchored in the road of Anamooka.
Immediately on our arrival, a large sailing canoe was
hired, and Lieut. Hayward and one private sent to the
Happai and Feegee Islands,<a name="FNanchor_132-1" id="FNanchor_132-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_132-1" class="fnanchor">[132-1]</a> to make inquiry after the
<i>Bounty</i> and our tender; but received no intelligence.
Here they found an axe, which had been left by Capt.
Cook, and bartered with the natives of the different
islands for hogs, yams, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The people of Anamooka are the most daring set of
robbers in the South Seas; and, with the greatest deference
and submission to Capt. Cook, I think the name of
Friendly Isles is a perfect misnomer, as their behaviour
to himself, to us, and to Capt. Bligh's unfortunate boat at
Murderer's Cove, pretty clearly evinces. Indeed Murderer's
Cove, in the Friendly Isles, is saying a volume on
the subject.</p>

<p>Two or three of the officers were taking a walk on shore
one evening, who had the precaution to take their pistols
with them. They seemed to crowd round us with more
than idle curiosity; but, on presenting the pistols to
them, they sheered off. The Captain soon joined us,
and brought his servant with him, carrying a bag of nails,
and some trifling presents, which he meant to distribute
amongst them; but he took the bag from him, and
dispatched him with a message to the boat, on which the
crowd followed him. As soon as he got out of our sight,
they stripped him naked, and robbed him of his cloaths,
and every article he had, but one shoe, which he used for
concealing his nakedness. At this juncture Lieut. Hayward
arrived from his expedition, and called the assistance
of the guard in searching for the robbers. We saw
the natives all running, and dodging behind the trees, which
led us to suspect there was some mischief brewing; but
we soon discovered the great Irishman, with his shoe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>
full in one hand, and a bayonet in the other, naked and
foaming mad with revenge on the natives, for the treatment
he had received. Night coming on, we went on
board, without recovering the poor fellow's cloathes.</p>

<p>Next day we were honoured with a visit from Tatafee,
king of Anamooka, who was of lineal descent from the
same family that reigned in the island when discovered
by Tasman, the Dutch circumnavigator; and the story
of his landing and supplying them with dogs and hogs,
is handed down, by oral tradition, to this day.<a name="FNanchor_133-1" id="FNanchor_133-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_133-1" class="fnanchor">[133-1]</a></p>

<p>Here society may be said to exist in the second stage
with respect to Otaheite. As land is scarcer, private
property is more exactly ascertained, and each man's
possession fenced in with a beautiful Chinese railing.
Highways, and roads leading to public places, are neatly
fenced in on each side, and a handsome approach to their
houses by a gravel-walk, with shubbery planted with some
degree of taste on each side of it. Many of them had
rows of pine apples on each side of the avenue. Messrs.
Hayward and Corner, with their usual benevolence,
took much pains in teaching them the manner of transplanting
their pine-apples; which hint they immediately
adopted, and were very thankful for any advice, either in
rearing their fruit, or cultivating their ground. The
shaddocks are superior in flavour to those of the West
Indies; and they will soon have oranges from what we
have left amongst them.</p>

<p>The women here are extremely beautiful; and although
they want that feminine softness of manners which the
Otaheite women possess in so eminent a degree, their
matchless vivacity, and fine animated countenances,
compensate the want of the softer blandishments of their
sister island.</p>

<p>There is a favourite amusement of the ladies here, (the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>
cup and ball), such as children play at in England. It
serves to give them a d&eacute;gag&eacute; kind of air, by which means
you have a more elegant display of their charms. They
are well aware of their fascinating powers, and use them
with as much address as our fine women do notting, and
other acts of industry. Trade went briskly on. They
brought abundance of hogs, and several ton weight of
very excellent yams. We found that the pork took salt,
and was cured much better here than at Otaheite.</p>

<p>Many beautiful girls were brought on board for sale
by their mothers, who were very exorbitant in their
demands, as nothing less than a broad axe would satisfy
them; but after standing their market three days, <i>la
pucelage</i> fell to an old razor, a pair of scissors, or a very
large nail. Indeed this trade was pushed to so great a
height, that the quarter-deck became the scene of the
most indelicate familiarities. Nor did the unfeeling
mothers commiserate with the pain and suffering of the
poor girls, but seemed to enjoy it as a monstrous good
thing. It is customary here, when girls meet with an
accident of this kind, that a council of matrons is held,
and the noviciate has a gash made in her fore finger. We
soon observed a number of cut fingers amongst them;
and had the razors held out, I believe all the girls in the
island would have undergone the same operation.</p>

<p>A party was sent on shore to cut wood for fuel, and
grass for the sheep; but they would not permit a blade of
grass to be cut till they were paid for it.</p>

<p>The watering party shared the same fate; and notwithstanding
a guard of armed men were sent to protect
the others whilst on that duty, the natives were continually
harassing them, and commiting depredations.
One of them came behind Lieut. Corner, and made a
blow at him with his club, which luckily missed his head,
and only stunned him in the back of the neck; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
while in that state, snatched his handkerchief from him;
but Mr. Corner recovering before the thief got out of sight,
levelled his piece and shot him dead.</p>

<p>Tatafee<a name="FNanchor_135-1" id="FNanchor_135-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_135-1" class="fnanchor">[135-1]</a> the king was going to collect tribute from the
islands under his jurisdiction, and went in the frigate to
Tofoa; but previous to our sailing, a letter was left to
Mr. Oliver, the commander of the tender, should he chance
to arrive before our return, with Macaucala, a principal
chief. In the night, the burning mountain on Tofoa
exhibited a very grand spectacle; and in the morning two
canoes were sent on shore, to announce the arrival of
those two great personages, Tatafee and Toobou, who went
on shore in the <i>Pandora's</i> barge, to give them more
consequence; but the tributary princes came off in canoes,
to do homage to Tatafee before he reached the shore.
They came alongside the barge, lowered their heads over
the side of the canoe, and Tatafee, agreeable to their
custom, put his foot upon their heads. When on shore,
what presents he had received from us, he distributed
amongst his subjects, with a liberality worthy of a great
prince.</p>

<p>Some of the people were here who behaved with such
savage barbarity to Capt. Bligh's boat at Murderer's
Cove. They perfectly recollected Mr. Hayward, and
seemed to shrink from him. Captain Edwards took
much pains with Tatafee, the king, to make him sensible
of his disapprobation of their conduct to Capt. Bligh's
boat. But conciliatory and gentle means were all that
could be enjoined at present, lest our tender should
fall in amongst them.</p>

there can be little doubt that Midshipman Sival perished at sea, but
neither Edwards nor Hamilton are to be censured, the former for
despatching a boat on ordinary duty, the latter for penning a

<h3>VOYAGE FROM ANAMOOKA, WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE
LOSS OF THE <i>PANDORA</i>.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wind not permitting us to visit Tongataboo, we
proceeded to Catooa and Navigator's Isles, the loss of
our tender having prevented us from doing it before,
and endeavoured to fall in with the eastermost of these
islands.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th of July, we discovered a
cluster of islands in the N.W. quarter; but the wind being
favourable for us, left examining of them till our return
to the Friendly Isles.<a name="FNanchor_136-1" id="FNanchor_136-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_136-1" class="fnanchor">[136-1]</a> On the 14th, in the forenoon,
saw three isles, supposed to be the cluster of isles called
by Bougainville Navigator's Isles. The largest the
natives called Tumaluah.<a name="FNanchor_136-2" id="FNanchor_136-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_136-2" class="fnanchor">[136-2]</a> We passed them at a little
distance, and found much intreaty necessary to bring
them on board.</p>

<p>On the 15th, we saw another island, which proved to be
Otutuelah,<a name="FNanchor_136-3" id="FNanchor_136-3"></a><a href="#Footnote_136-3" class="fnanchor">[136-3]</a> which has been already described. Here
we found some of the French navigator's cloathing and
buttons; and there is little doubt but they have murdered
them.<a name="FNanchor_136-4" id="FNanchor_136-4"></a><a href="#Footnote_136-4" class="fnanchor">[136-4]</a></p>

<p>On the 18th, saw the group of islands we discovered
on our way here; and on the 19th, ran down the north
side till we came to an opening, where we saw the sea on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
the other side. A sound is formed here by some islands
to the south east and north west, and interior bays,
which promises better anchorage than any other place
in the Friendly Isles. The natives told us there were
excellent watering-places in several different parts within
the sound. The country is well wooded. Several of the
inferior chiefs were on board, one of the Tatafee, and one
of the Toobou family; but the principal chief was not on
board. We supposed he was coming off just as we sailed.<a name="FNanchor_137-1" id="FNanchor_137-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_137-1" class="fnanchor">[137-1]</a>
The natives in general were very fair and honourable in
their dealings. They were more inoffensive and better
behaved than any we had seen for some time. They have
frequent intercourse with Anamooka, and their religion,
customs, and language, are the same.</p>

<p>A number of beautiful paroquets were brought off by
the natives, all remarkable for the richness and variety
of their plumage.</p>

<p>The group of islands was called Howe's Islands, but were
particularly distinguished by the names of Barrington's,
Sawyer's, Hotham's, and Jarvis's Islands. The sound
itself was called Curtis's Sound. Under the general
denomination of Howe's Islands, were included several
islands to the south east, to which we gave no particular
name, and two more islands to the westward, called
Bickerton's Islands, including two small islands near the
above. There seems to be a tolerable landing-place on
the north-west side of Gardner's Island. All this part of
the island has a most barren aspect. There were evident
marks of volcanic eruptions having happened. The very
singular appearance which this part of the island presented,
I cannot omit mentioning; it bore the figure of a piece
of flat table-land, without the slightest eminence or
indentation, and smoke was issuing from the edges,
round its whole circumference.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>
On the 23rd, we passed an inhabited island, which we
supposed to be the Pylestaart island. It has two remarkable
high peaks upon it.</p>

<p>On the 26th, we saw Middleburg Island, and run down
between it and Euah; examined it without success;
passed Tongatabu; got some provisions here, but found
the water brackish.</p>

<p>On the 29th, we anchored again in the road of Anamooka.
We were sorry to hear the tender had not been
there. On the 5th of August, we again proceeded on our
voyage. As the occurrences at this time bore some
semblance to the transactions in our last visit, to avoid
wounding the delicate, or satiating the licentious, we shall
conclude in the torpid phraseology of the log, with ditto
repeated.</p>

<p>Every thing being ready for sea on the 3d day of August,
we sailed from Anamooka; and on the 5th, discovered
an island of some considerable extent, called by the
natives Onooafow,<a name="FNanchor_138-1" id="FNanchor_138-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_138-1" class="fnanchor">[138-1]</a> which we called Proby's Island, in
honour of Commissioner Proby. We traded with the
inhabitants for some hours. The land was hilly, and the
houses of much larger construction than we had observed
in those seas.</p>

<p>We were now convinced that we were further to the
westward than we imagined, and therefore shaped a
course to fall in to the eastward of Wallis's Island; and
next day fell in with it. We gave presents, as customary,
to the first boat; who, from a theft they committed, were
afraid to return. Their cheek-bones were much bruised
and flattened, and some had both their little fingers
cut off.<a name="FNanchor_138-2" id="FNanchor_138-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_138-2" class="fnanchor">[138-2]</a></p>

<p>We bore away, intending to steer in the track of Carteret
and Bligh, between Spirito Santo and Santa Cruz; and
on the 8th saw land to the westward. We sounded, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>
found no bottom. We run down the island, and saw a
vast number of houses amongst the trees. It is very hilly,
and, from the great height of some of them, may be called
mountains. They are cultivated to the top; the reason
of which, I presume, is from its being so full of inhabitants.
It is about seven miles long; and being a new discovery,
we called it Grenville's Island, in honour of Lord Grenville.
The name the natives gave it is Rotumah. They came off
in a fleet of canoes, rested on their paddles, and gave the
war-hoop at stated periods. They were all armed with
clubs, and meant to attack us; but the magnitude and
novelty of such an object as a man of war, struck them
with a mixture of wonder and fear. They were, however,
perfectly ignorant of fire-arms, and seemed much
startled at the report of a musket, were too shy to
stand the experiment of a great gun. As they came
off with hostile intentions, they brought no women with
them.</p>

<p>They wore necklaces, bracelets, and girdles of white
shells. Their bodies were curiously marked with the
figures of men, dogs, fishes, and birds, upon every part of
them; so that every man was a moving landscape. These
marks were all raised, and done, I suppose, by pinching
up the skin.</p>

<p>They were great adepts in thieving, and uncommonly
athletic and strong. One fellow was making off with
some booty, but was detected; and although five of the
stoutest men in the ship were hanging upon him, and had
fast hold of his long flowing black hair, he overpowered
them all, and jumped overboard with his prize. There
is a high promontory on this island, which we named
Mount Temple.</p>

<p>On the 11th, no land being then in sight, we run over
a reef of coral, in eleven fathom water. We were much
alarmed, but passed it in five minutes; and on sounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
immediately afterwards, found no bottom. This was
called Pandora's Reef.</p>

<p>On the 12th, in the morning, we discovered an island
well wooded, but not inhabited. It had two remarkable
promontories on it, one resembling a mitre, and the
other a steeple; from whence we called it Mitre Island.
We passed it, and stood to the westward; and at ten,
the same morning, discovered another island to the north
west. It is entirely cultivated, and a vast number of
inhabitants, though only a mile in length. The beach
from the east, round by the south, is a white sand, but too
much surf for a boat to attempt to land. In gratitude
for the many good things we had on board, and the very
high state of preservation in which they kept, we called
this Cherry's Island, in honour of &mdash;&mdash; Cherry, Esq;
Commissioner of the Victualling-office.<a name="FNanchor_140-1" id="FNanchor_140-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_140-1" class="fnanchor">[140-1]</a></p>

<p>On the 13th of August, we discovered another island
to the north west. It is mountainous, and covered with
wood to the very summit. We saw no inhabitants, but
smoke in many different parts of it, from which it may
be presumed it is inhabited. This we called Pitt's
Island.<a name="FNanchor_140-2" id="FNanchor_140-2"></a><a href="#Footnote_140-2" class="fnanchor">[140-2]</a></p>

<p>On the 17th, at midnight, we discovered breakers on
each bow. We had just room to wear ship; and as this
merciful escape was from the vigilance of one Wells, who
was looking out ahead, it was called Wells's Shoals.
Those hair-breadth escapes may point out the propriety
of a consort. In the morning, at day-light, we put about,
to examine the danger we were in, and found we had got
embayed in a double reef, which will very soon be an
island. We run round its north west end, and on the
23d saw land, which we supposed to be the Luisiade, a
cape bearing north east and by east. We called it Cape
Rodney. Another contiguous to it was called Cape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
Hood; and a mountain between them, we named Mount
Clarence.</p>

<p>After passing Cape Hood, the land appears lower, and
to trench away about north west, forming a deep bay;
and it may be doubted whether it joins New Guinea or
not.</p>

<p>We pursued our course to the westward, keeping
Endeavour Straits open, by which means we hoped to
avoid the dangers Capt. Cook met with in higher latitudes.</p>

<p>On the 25th, saw breakers; hauled up, and passed to
the westward of them; the sea broke very gently on them.
To these we gave the name of Look-out Shoals. Before
noon we saw more breakers, the reef of which was composed
of very large stones, and called it Stony-reef Island.</p>

<p>On seeing obstruction to the southward, stood to the
westward, where there appeared to be an opening. We
saw an island in that direction, and a reef extending a
considerable way to the north west. Hauled upon the
wind, seeing our passage obstructed, and stood off and
on, under an easy sail in the night, till daylight; and in
the morning bore away, and discovered four islands, to
which the name of Murray's Islands was given. On the
top of the largest, there was something resembling a
fortification. We saw at the same time three two-masted
boats. We kept running along the reef, and in
the forenoon thought we saw an opening. Lieut. Corner
was immediately ordered to get ready, to discover if there
was a passage for the ship, and went to the topmasthead,
to look well round him before he left us. It was judged
necessary that he should take with him an axe, some fuel,
provisions, a little water, and a compass, previous to his
departure.</p>

<p>It was now the 28th of August. It had lately been our
custom to lay to in the night, M. Bougainville having
represented this part of the ocean as exceedingly dan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>gerous;
and it certainly is the boldest piece of navigation
that has ever yet been attempted. We would gladly
have continued the same custom; but the great length
of the voyage would not permit it, as, after we had passed
to the wastward of Bougainville's track, the ocean was
perfectly unexplored.</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon, a signal was made from the
boat, that a passage through the reef was discovered for
the ship; but wishing to be well informed in so intricate
a business, and the day being far spent, we waited the
boats coming on board, made a signal to expedite her, and
afterwards repeated it. Night closing fast upon us, and
considering our former misfortunes of losing the tender
and jolly-boat, rendered it necessary, both for the preservation
of the boat, and the success of the voyage, to
endeavour, by every possible means, to get hold of her.</p>

<p>False fires were burnt, and muskets fired from the ship,
and answered by the boat reciprocally; and as the flashes
from their muskets were distinctly seen by us, she was
reasonably soon expected on board. We now sounded,
but had no bottom with a hundred and ten fathom line,
till past seven o'clock, when we got ground in fifty fathom.
The boat was now seen close under the stern; we were
at the same time lying to, to prevent the ship fore-reaching.
Immediately on sounding this last time, the topsails
were filled; but before the tacks were hauled on board,
and the sails trimmed, she struck on a reef of rocks, and
at that instant the boat got on board. Every possible
effort was attempted to get her off by the sails; but that
failing, they were furled, and the boats hoisted out with
a view to carry out an anchor. Before that was accomplished,
the carpenter reported she made eighteen inches
water in five minutes; and in a quarter of an hour more,
she had nine feet water in the hold.</p>

<p>The hands were immediately turned to the pumps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>
and to bale at the different hatchways. Some of the
prisoners were let out of irons, and turned to the pumps.
At this dreadful crisis, it blew very violently; and she
beat so hard upon the rocks, that we expected her, every
minute, to go to pieces. It was an exceeding dark,
stormy night; and the gloomy horrors of death presented
us all round, being every where encompassed with rocks,
shoals, and broken water. About ten she beat over the
reef; and we let go the anchor in fifteen fathom water.</p>

<p>The guns were ordered to be thrown overboard; and
what hands could be spared from the pumps, were employed
thrumbing a topsail to haul under her bottom,
to endeavour to fodder her. To add to our distress, at
this juncture one of the chain-pumps gave way; and she
gained fast upon us. The scheme of the topsail was now
laid aside, and every soul fell to baling and pumping. All
the boats, excepting one, were obliged to keep a long
distance off on account of the broken water, and the
very high surf that was running near us. We baled
between life and death; for had she gone down before
day-light, every soul must have perished. She now took
a heel, and some of the guns they were endeavouring to
throw over board run down to leeward, which crushed one
man to death; about the same time, a spare topmast
came down from the booms, and killed another man.</p>

<p>The people now became faint at the pumps, and it was
necessary to give them some refreshment. We had
luckily between decks a cask of excellent strong ale,
which we brewed at Anamooka. This was tapped, and
served regularly to all hands, which was much preferable
to spirits, as it gave them strength without intoxication.
During this trying occasion, the men behaved with the
utmost intrepidity and obedience, not a man flinching
from his post. We continually cheered them at the pumps
with the delusive hopes of its being soon day-light.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
About half an hour before day-break, a council of war
was held amongst the officers; and as she was then
settling fast down in the water, it was their unanimous
opinion, that nothing further could be done for the preservation
of his Majesty's ship; and it was their next care
to save the lives of the crew. To effect which, spars,
booms, hen-coops, and every thing buoyant was cut loose,
that when she went down, they might chance to get hold
of something. The prisoners were ordered to be let out
of irons. The water was now coming faster in at the gun-ports
than the pumps could discharge; and to this
minute the men never swerved from their duty. She now
took a very heavy heel, so much that she lay quite down
on one side.</p>

<p>One of the officers now told the Captain, who was
standing aft, that the anchor on our bow was under
water; that she was then going; and, bidding him farewell,
jumped over the quarter into the water. The Captain
then followed his example, and jumped after him. At
that instant she took her last heel; and, while every one
were scrambling to windward, she sunk in an instant.
The crew had just time to leap over board, accompanying
it with a most dreadful yell. The cries of the men drowning
in the water was at first awful in the extreme; but
as they sunk, and became faint, it died away by degrees.
The boats, who were at some considerable distance in
the drift of the tide, in about half an hour, or little better,
picked up the remainder of our wretched crew.</p>

<p>Morning now dawned, and the sun shone out. A sandy
key, four miles off, and about thirty paces long, afforded
us a resting place; and when all the boats arrived, we
mustered our remains, and found that thirty-five men and
four prisoners were drowned.</p>

<p>After we had a little recovered our strength, the first
care was to haul up the boats. A guard was placed over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
the prisoners. Providentially a small barrel of water,
a cag of wine, some biscuit, and a few muskets and
cartouch boxes, had been thrown into the boat. The heat
of the sun, and the reflection from the sand, was now
excruciating; and our stomachs being filled with salt
water, from the great length of time we were swimming
before we were picked up, rendered our thirst most
intolerable; and no water was allowed to be served out
the first day. By a calculation which we made, by filling
the compass boxes, and every utensil we had, we could
admit an allowance of two small wine glasses of water
a-day to each man for sixteen days.</p>

<p>A saw and hammer had fortunately been in one of the
boats, which enabled us, with the greater expedition, to
make preparations for our voyage, by repairing one of
the boats, which was in a very bad state, and cutting up
the floor-boards of all the boats into uprights, round
which we stretched canvas, to keep the water from breaking
into the boats at sea. We made tents of the boats'
sails; and when it was dark, we set the watch, and went
to sleep. In the night we were disturbed by the irregular
behaviour of one Connell, which led us to suspect he had
stole our wine, and got drunk; but, on further inquiry,
we found that the excruciating torture he suffered from
thirst led him to drink salt water; by which means he
went mad, and died in the sequel of the voyage.</p>

<p>Next morning Mr. George Passmore, the master, was
dispatched in one of the boats to visit the wreck, to see
if any thing floated round her that might be useful to
us in our present distressed state. He returned in two
hours, and brought with him a cat, which he found
clinging to the top-gallant-mast-head; a piece of the
top-gallant-mast, which he cut away; and about fifteen
feet of the lightning chain; which being copper, we cut
up, and converted into nails for fitting out the boats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
Some of the gigantic cockle was boiled, and cut into junks,
lest any one should be inclined to eat. But our thirst was
too excessive to bear any thing which would increase it.
This evening a wine glass of water was served to each man.
A paper-parcel of tea having been thrown into the boat,
the officers joined all their allowance, and had tea in the
Captain's tent with him. When it was boiled, every
one took a salt-cellar spoonful, and passed it to his neighbour;
by which means we moistened our mouths by slow
degrees, and received much refreshment from it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_IV" id="CHAP_IV"></a>CHAP. IV.</h2>

<h3>VOYAGE FROM THE WRECK TO THE ISLAND OF TIMOR.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> thing being ready on the following day, at twelve
o'clock, we embarked in our little squadron, each boat
having been previously supplied with the latitude and
longitude of the island of Timor, eleven hundred miles
from this place.</p>

<p>Our order of sailing was as follows.</p>

<p>In the Pinnace:</p>

<ul class="plain"><li>Capt. Edwards,</li>
<li>Lieut. Hayward,</li>
<li>Mr. Rickards, Master's Mate,</li>
<li>Mr. Packer, Gunner,</li>
<li>Mr. Edmonds, Captain's Clerk,<ul class="plain">
<li>    Three Prisoners,</li>
<li>    Sixteen Privates.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Red Yaul:</p>

<ul class="plain"><li>Lieut. Larkan,</li>
<li>Mr. Geo. Hamilton, Surgeon,</li>
<li>Mr. Reynolds, Master's Mate,</li>
<li>Mr. Matson, Midshipman,<ul class="plain">
<li>    Two Prisoners,</li>
<li>    Eighteen Privates.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Launch:</p>

<ul class="plain"><li>Lieut. Corner,</li>
<li>Mr. Gregory Bentham, Purser,</li>
<li>Mr. Montgomery, Carpenter,</li>
<li>Mr. Bowling, Master's Mate,</li>
<li>Mr. M'Kendrick, Midshipman,<ul class="plain">
<li>    Two Prisoners,</li>
<li>    Twenty-four Privates.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Blue Yaul:</p>
<ul class="plain"><li>Mr. Geo. Passmore, Master,</li>
<li>Mr. Cunningham, Boatswain,</li>
<li>Mr. James Innes, Surgeon's Mate,</li>
<li>Mr. Fenwick, Midshipman,</li>
<li>Mr. Pycroft, Midshipman,<ul class="plain">
<li>    Three Prisoners,</li>
<li>    Fifteen Privates.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>As soon as embarked, we laid the oars upon the thwarts,
which formed a platform, by which means we stowed
two tier of men. A pair of wooden scales was made in
each boat, and a musket-ball weight of bread served to
each man. At meridian we saw a key, bounded with
large craggy rocks. As the principal part of our subsistence
was in the launch, it was necessary to keep together,
both for our defence and support. We towed each other
during the night, and at day-break cast off the tow-line.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning, the red and blue yauls were
sent ahead, to sound and investigate the coast of New
South Wales, and to search for a watering-place. The
country had been described as very destitute of the article
of water; but on entering a very fine bay, we found most
excellent water rushing from a spring at the very edge
of the beach. Here we filled our bellies, a tea-kettle,
and two quart bottles. The pinnace and launch had
gone too far ahead to observe any signal of our success;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
and immediately we made sail after them. The coast
has a very barren aspect; and, from the appearance of
the soil and land, looks like a country abounding with
minerals.</p>

<p>As we passed round the bay, two canoes, with three
black men in each, put off, and paddled very hard to get
near us. They stood up in the canoes, waved, and made
many signs for us to come to them. But as they were
perfectly naked, had a very savage aspect, and having
heard an indifferent account of the natives of that country,
we judged it prudent to avoid them.</p>

<p>In two hours we joined the pinnace and launch, who
were lying to for us. At ten at night we were alarmed with
the dreadful cry of breakers ahead. We had got amongst
a reef of rocks; and in our present state, being worn out
and fatigued, it is difficult to say how we got out of them,
as the place was fraught with danger all round; for in
standing clear of Scylla, we might fall foul of Charybdis;
the horror of which, considering our present situation,
may be better understood than expressed. After running
along, we came to an inhabited island, from which we
promised ourselves a supply of water. On our approach,
the natives flocked down to the beach in crowds. They
were jet black, and neither sex had either covering or
girdle. We made signals of distress to them for something
to drink, which they understood; and on receiving some
trifling presents of knives, and some buttons cut off our
coats, they brought us a cag of good water, which we
emptied in a minute, and then sent it back to be filled
again. They, however, would not bring it the second
time, but put it down on the beach, and made signs to
us to come on shore for it. This we declined, as we
observed the women and children running, and supplying
the men with bows and arrows. In a few minutes, they
let fly a shower of arrows amongst the thick of us. Luckily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
we had not a man wounded; but an arrow fell between
the Captain and Third Lieutenant, and went through
the boats thwart, and stuck in it. It was an oak-plank
inch thick. We immediately discharged a volley of
muskets at them, which put them to flight. There were,
however, none of them killed. We now abandoned all
hopes of refreshment here. This island lies contiguous
to Mountainous Island.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that the channel throughout the
reef is better than any hitherto known. We ascertained
the latitudes with the greatest accuracy and exactness;
and should government be inclined to plant trees on those
sandy keys, particularly the outermost one, it would
be a good distinguishing mark; and many difficulties
which Capt. Cook experienced to the southward would
also be avoided. The cocoa-nut tree, on account of its
hardy nature, and the Norfolk and common pines, might
be preferred, from their height rendering the place more conspicuous.
The tides or currents are strong and irregular
here, as may be expected, from the extending reefs,
shoals, and keys, and its vicinity to Endeavour Straits.</p>

<p>We steered from these hostile savages to other islands
in sight, and sent some armed men on shore, with orders
to keep pretty near us, and to run close along shore in
the boats. But they returned without success. This
island we called Plumb Island, from its bearing an
austere, astringent kind of fruit, resembling plumbs, but
not fit to eat.</p>

<p>In the evening, we steered for those islands which we
supposed were called the Prince of Wales's Islands; and
about two o'clock in the morning, came to an anchor
with a grappling, along side of an island, which we called
Laforey's Island. As the night was very dark, and this
was the last land that could afford us relief, all hands
went to sleep, to refresh our woe-worn spirits.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
The morning was ushered in with the howling of wolves,
who had smelt us in the night, when prowling for food.
Lieut. Corner and a party were sent at day-light, to
search again for water; and, as we approached, the wild
beasts retired, and filled the woods with their hideous
growling. As soon as we landed, we discovered a foot-path
which led down into a hollow, where we were led
to suspect that water might be found; and on digging
four or five feet, we had the ecstatic pleasure to see a spring
rush out. A glad messenger was immediately dispatched
to the beach, to make a signal to the boats of our success.
On traversing the shore, we discovered a morai, or rather
a heap of bones. There were amongst them two human
skulls, the bones of some large animals, and some turtle-bones.
They were heaped together in the form of a grave,
and a very long paddle, supported at each end by a bifurcated
branch of a tree, was laid horizontally alongst it.</p>

<p>Near to this, there were marks of a fire having been
recently made. The ground about was much footed and
wore; whence it may be presumed feasts or sacrifices
had been frequently held, as there were several foot-paths
which led to this spot. After having gorged our parched
bodies with water, till we were perfectly water-logged,
we began to feel the cravings of hunger; a new sensation
of misery we had hitherto been strangers to, from the
excess of thirst predominating. Some of our stragglers
were lucky enough to find a few small oysters on the shore.
A harsh, austere, astringent kind of fruit, resembling a
plumb, was found in some places. As I discovered some
to be pecked at by the birds, we permitted the men to fill
their bellies with them. There was a small berry, of a
similar taste to the plumb, which was found by some of
the party. On observing the dung of some of the larger
animals, many of them were found in it, in an undigested
state; we therefore concluded we might venture upon them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
with safety. We carefully avoided shooting at any bird,
lest the report of the muskets should alarm the natives,
whom we had every reason to suspect were at no great
distance, from the number of foot paths that led over the
hill, and the noise we heard at intervals. Centinels
were placed to prevent stragglers of our party from
exceeding the proper bounds; and when every other thing
was filled with water, the carpenter's boots were also
filled. The water in them was first served out, on account
of leakage.</p>

<p>There is a large sound formed here, to which we gave
the name of Sandwich's Sound, and commodious anchorage
for shipping in the bay, to which we gave the name of
Wolf's Bay, in which there is from five to seven fathom
water all round. This is extremely well situated for a
rendezvous in surveying Endeavour Straits; and were a
little colony settled here, a concatenation of Christian
settlements would enchain the world, and be useful to
any unfortunate ship of whatever nation, that might be
wrecked in these seas; or, should a rupture take place
in South America, a great vein of commerce might find
its way through this channel.</p>

<p>Hammond's Island lies north west and by west, Parker's
Island from north and by west to north and by east, and
an island seen to the north entrance north west. We
supposed it to be an island called by Captain Bligh
Mountainous Island, laid down in latitude 10.16 South.</p>

<p>Sandwich's Sound is formed by Hammond's, Parker's,
and a cluster of small islands on the starboard hand, at
its eastern entrance. We also called a back land behind
Hammond's Island, and the other islands to the southward
of it, Cornwallis's Land. The uppermost part of the
mountain was separated from the main by a large gap.
Under the gap, low land was seen; but whether that was
a continuation of the main or not, we could not determine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>
Near the centre of the sound is a small dark-coloured,
rocky island.</p>

<p>This afternoon, at three o'clock, being the 2d of September,
our little squadron sailed again, and in the evening
saw a high peaked island lying north west, which we called
Hawkesbury's Island. The passage through the north
entrance is about two miles wide. After passing through
it, saw a reef. As we approached it, we shallowed our
water to three fathom; but on hauling up more to the
south west, we deepened it again to six fathom. Saw
several very large turtle, but could not catch any of them.
After clearing the reef, stood to the westward. Mountainous
Island bore N. half E.; Capt. Bligh's west island,
which appears in Three Hummocks, N.N.W.; a rock
N.W. at the S.W. extreme of the main land, S. and by E.;
and the northernmost cape of New South Wales, S.S.E.;
and to the extreme of the land in sight, the eastward E.
half N. a small distance from the nearest of the Prince
of Wales's Islands, we discovered another island, and
which we called Christian's Island. Saw Two Hummock
between Hawkesbury's Island and Mountainous Island;
but could not be certain whether it was one or two islands.</p>

<p>We now entered the great Indian ocean, and had a
voyage of a thousand miles to undertake in our open
boats. As soon as we cleared the land, we found a very
heavy swell running, which threatened destruction to
our little fleet; for should we have separated, we must
inevitably perish for want of water, as we had not <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'untensils'">utensils</ins>
to divide our slender stock. For our mutual preservation,
we took each other in tow again; but the sea was so
rough, and the swell running so high, we towed very hard,
and broke a new tow-line. This put us in the utmost confusion,
being afraid of dashing to pieces upon each other,
as it was a very dark night. We again made fast to each
other; but the tow-line breaking a second time, we were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>
obliged to trust ourselves to the mercy of the waves. At
five in the morning, the pinnace lay to, as the other boats
had passed her under a dark cloud; but on the signal
being made for the boats to join, we again met at day-light.
At meridian, we passed some remarkable black
and yellow striped sea snakes. On the afternoon of the
4th of September, gave out the exact latitude of our
rendezvous in writing; also the longitude by the time-keeper
at this present time, in case of unavoidable
separation.</p>

<p>On the night between the 5th and 6th, the sea running
very cross and high, the tow-line broke several times;
the boats strained, and made much water; and we were
obliged to leave off towing the rest of the voyage, or it
would have dragged the boats asunder. On the 7th, the
Captain's boat caught a booby. They sucked his blood,
and divided him into twenty-four shares.</p>

<p>The men who were employed steering the boats, were
often subject to a <i>coup de soleil</i>, as every one else were
continually wetting their shirts overboard, and putting
it upon their head, which alleviated the scorching heat
of the sun, to which we were entirely exposed, most of us
having lost our hats while swimming at the time the ship
was wrecked. It may be observed, that this method of
wetting our bodies with salt water is not advisable, if
the misery is protracted beyond three or four days, as,
after that time, the great absorption from the skin that
takes place from the increased heat and fever, makes
the fluids become tainted with the bittern of the salt
water; so much so, that the saliva became intolerable in
the mouth. It may likewise be worthy of remark, that
those who drank their own urine died in the sequel of the
voyage.</p>

<p>We now neglected weighing our slender allowance of
bread, our mouths becoming so parched, that few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
attempted to eat; and what was not claimed was thrown
into the general stock. We found old people suffer much
more than those that were young. A particular instance
of that we observed in one young boy, a midshipman,
who sold his allowance of water two days for one allowance
of bread. As their sufferings continued, they
became very cross and savage in their temper. In the
Captain's boat, one of the prisoners took to praying, and
they gathered round him with much attention and seeming
devotion. But the Captain suspecting the purity of his
doctrines, and unwilling he should make a monopoly
of the business, gave prayers himself. On the 9th, we
passed a great many of the Nautilus fish, the shell of which
served us to put our glass of water into; by which means
we had more time granted to dip our finger in it, and wet
our mouths by slow degrees. There were several flocks
of birds seen flying in a direction for the land.</p>

<p>On the 13th, in the morning, we saw the land, and the
discoverer was immediately rewarded with a glass of water;
but, as if our cup of misery was not completely full, it
fell a dead calm. The boats now all separated, every
one pushing to make the land. Next day we got pretty
near it; but there was a prodigious surf running. Two
of our men slung a bottle about their necks, jumped overboard,
and swam through the surf. They traversed over
a good many miles, till a creek intercepted them; when
they came down to the beach, and made signs to us of
their not having succeeded. We then brought the boat
as near the surf as we durst venture, and picked them up.
In running along the coast, about twelve o'clock, we had
the pleasure to see the red yaul get into a creek. She had
hoisted an English jack at her mast-head, that we might
observe her in running down the coast. There was a
prodigious surf, and many dangerous shoals, between us
and the mouth of the creek; we, however, began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>
share the remains of our water, and about half a bottle
came to each man's share, which we dispatched in an
instant.</p>

<p>We now gained fresh spirits, and hazarded every thing
in gaining our so much wished for haven. It is but justice
here to acknowledge how much we were indebted to the
intrepidity, courage, and seaman-like behaviour of Mr.
Reynolds the master's mate, who fairly beat her over all
the reefs, and brought us safe on shore. The crew of
the blue yaul, who had been two or three hours landed,
assisted in landing our party. A fine spring of water
near to the creek afforded us immediate relief. As soon
as we had filled our belly, a guard was placed over the
prisoners, and we went to sleep for a few hours on the
grass.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, a Chinese chief came down the creek
in a canoe, attended by some of the natives, to wait upon
us. He was a venerable looking old man; we endeavoured
to walk down to the water-side, to receive him, and acquaint
him with the nature of our distress.</p>

<p>We addressed him in French and in English, neither
of which he understood; but misery was so strongly
depicted in our countenances, that language was superfluous.
The tears trickling down his venerable cheeks
convinced us he saw and felt our misfortunes; and
silence was eloquence on the subject.</p>

<p>He made us understand by signs, that without fee or
reward we should be supplied with horses, and conducted
to Coupang, a Dutch East-India settlement, about
seventy miles distant, the place of our rendezvous. This
we politely declined, as the nature of our duty in the
charge of the prisoners would not admit of it. We took
leave of him for the present, after receiving promises of
refreshment.</p>

<p>Soon after, crowds of the natives came down with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>
fowls, pigs, milk, and bread. Mr. Innes, the surgeon's
mate, happened luckily to have some silver in his pocket,
to which they applied the touchstone, but would not give
us any thing for guineas. However, anchor-buttons
answered the purpose, as they gave us provision for
a few buttons, which they refused the same number of
guineas for; till a hungry dog, one of the carpenter's
crew, happening to pick up an officer's jacket, spoiled the
market, by giving it, buttons and all, for a pair of fowls,
which a few buttons might have purchased.</p>

<p>All hands were busied in roasting the fowls, and boiling
the pork; in the evening we made a very hearty supper.
While we were regaling ourselves round a large fire, some
wild beast gave a roar in the bushes. Some who had been
in India before, declared it was the jackall; we therefore,
concluded the lion could not be far off. Some were
jocularly observing what a glorious supper the lord of
the forest would make of us; but others were rather
troubled with the dismaloes. This gave a gloomy turn to
the conversation; and our minds having been previously
much engaged with savages and wild beasts, and our
bodies worn out through famine and watching, I believe
the contagious effects of fear became pretty general.
From Bligh's narrative, and others, we had been warned
of the danger of landing in any other part of the island
of Timor but Coupang, the Dutch settlement, as they
were represented hostile and savage.</p>

<p>It is customary with those people, as we afterwards
learnt, to do their hard work, such as beating out their
rice at night, to avoid the scorching heat of the sun;
and the whole village, which was about two miles off,
joined in the general song, which every where chears
and accompanies labour. As they had made us great
offers for some cartridges of powder, which our duty
could not suffer us to part with, we immediately in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>terpreted
this song into the war-hoop, and concluded,
that they were going to take by force what they could
not gain by entreaty. Nature, however, at last worn
out, inclined to rest. The First Lieutenant and Master
went on board of the boats, which were at anchor in the
middle of the river, for the better security of the prisoners;
and, ranging ourselves round, with our feet to the fire, went
to sleep.</p>

<p>At dawn of day, the master gave the huntsman's hollow,
which some, from being suddenly awaked, thought they
were attacked by the Indians. We were all panic struck,
and could not get thoroughly awaked, being so exhausted,
and overpowered with sleep. Most of us were scrambling
upon all fours down to the river, and crying for Christ's
sake to have mercy upon them, till those who were foremost
in the scramble, in crawling into the creek, got
recovered from their plight by their hands being immersed
in water; yet those who were foremost in running away,
were not last in upbraiding the rest with cowardice,
notwithstanding there were pretty evident marks upon
some of them, of the cold water having produced its
usual effects of micturition.</p>

<p>Next day we went up the creek, in one of the boats,
about four miles, to one of their towns, with an intention
of purchasing provisions for our sea-store. As we entered
the town, the king was riding out, attended by twenty
carabineers or body-guards, well mounted, and respectably
armed. He passed us with all the <i>sang froid</i> imaginable,
scarce deigning to glance at us.</p>

<p>In purchasing a pig, the man finding a good price for
it, offered to traffic with us for the charms of his daughter,
a very pretty young girl. But none of us seemed inclined
that way, as there were many good things we stood much
more in need of.</p>

<p>At one o'clock, being high water, we embarked again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>
in our boats for Coupang. We sailed along the coast
all day till it was dark; and, fearful lest we should over-shoot
our port in the night, put into a bay. After laying
some time, we observed a light; and after hallooing
and making a noise, the natives came down with torches
in their hands, waded up alongside of us, and offered
their assistance, which we accepted of, in lighting fires,
and dressing the victuals we had brought with us, that no
time might be lost in landing or cooking the next day.</p>

<p>At day break, we again proceeded on our voyage, and
at five in the afternoon we landed at Coupang. The
Governor, Mynheer Vanion, received us with the utmost
politeness, kindness, and hospitality. The Lieutenant-Governor,
Mynheer Fry, was likewise extremely kind <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and and'">and</ins>
attentive, in rendering every assistance possible, and
in giving the necessary orders for our support and relief
in our present distressed state.</p>

<p>Next morning being Sunday, as we supposed, the 17th
of September, we were preparing for Church, to return
thanks to Almighty God, for his divine interposition in
our miraculous preservation; but were disappointed in
our pious intentions; for we found it was Monday, the
18th, having lost a day by performing a circuit of the globe
to the westward.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_V" id="CHAP_V"></a>CHAP. V.</h2>

<h3>OCCURRENCES AT COUPANG; VOYAGE TO BATAVIA, &amp;c.;
ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the Montpelier of the East to the Dutch and
Portuguese settlements in India; and, from the salubrity
of its air, is the favourite resort of valetudinarians and
invalids from Batavia and other places. This island is
fertile, variegated with hill and dale, and equally beautiful
as diversified with Rotti, and its appendant isles. It is as
large as the island of Great Britain. Its principal trade
is wax, honey, and sandlewood; but the whole of its
revenues do not defray the expence of the settlement
to the Company; but from the locality of its situation,
it is convenient for their other islands. They had the
monopoly of the sandlewood trade, which is used in all
temples, mosques, and places of worship in the East,
every Chinese having a sprig of it burning day and night
near their household-gods.</p>

<p>The exclusive trade of sandlewood was valuable and
convenient to the Dutch; but, from the vast extent of
territory lately acquired in India, we have plenty of that
commodity without going to the Dutch market. Close
to the Dutch town is a Chinese town and temple. They
have a governor of their own nation, but pay large
tribute to the Dutch. Notwithstanding their trade is
under very severe restrictions, they soon make rich;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
and, as soon as they become independent, return to their
own country. For European and India goods the natives
barter their produce, and sell their prisoners of war,
who are carried to Batavia as slaves, and the natives
of Java sent from Batavia to this place in return. As
they hold their tenure more from policy than strength,
it would be impolitic to irritate them, by exposing their
countrymen, subjugated to the lash of slavery and
oppression.</p>

<p>An instance of this soul-couping business fell under
our inspection while here. One of the petty princes, in
settling his account with a merchant of this place,
was some dollars short of cash. He just stepped to the
door, and casting his eye on an elderly man who was near
him, he laid hold of him; and, with the assistance of some
of his myrmidons, gave him up as a slave, and so settled
his account. We felt more interested in the fate of this
poor wretch, on account of his having been a prince
himself, but never before saw the face of his oppressor.
He went passenger in the ship with us to Batavia.</p>

<p>It was a pleasing and flattering sight to an Englishman,
at this remotest corner of the globe, to see that Wedgewood's
stoneware, and Birmingham goods, had found their
way into the shops of Coupang.</p>

<p>During our five weeks stay here, the Governor,
Mynheer Vanion, by every act of politeness and attention
endeavoured to make us spend our time agreeably. We
were sumptuously regaled at his table every day, and the
evening was spent with cards and concerts. I could
dwell with pleasure for an age in praise of this honest
Dutchman; it is the tribute of a grateful heart, and his
due. This is the third time he has had an opportunity
of extending his hospitality to shipwrecked Englishmen.</p>

<p>About a fortnight before we arrived, a boat, with eight
men, a woman, and two children, came on shore here, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
told him they were the supercargo, part of the crew, and
passengers of an English brig, wrecked in these seas. His
house, which has ever been the asylum of the distressed,
was open for their reception. They drew bills on the
British government, and were supplied with every
necessary they stood in need of.</p>

<p>The captain of a Dutch East Indiaman, who spoke
English, hearing of the arrival of Capt. Edwards, and
our unfortunate boat, run to them with the glad tidings
of their Captain having arrived; but one of them,
starting up in surprise, said, "What Captain! dam'me,
we have no Captain;" for they had reported, that the
Captain and remainder of the crew had separated from
them at sea in another boat. This immediately led to a
suspicion of their being impostors; and they were ordered
to be apprehended, and put into the castle. One of the
men, and the woman, fled into the woods; but were
soon taken. They confessed they were English convicts,
and that they had made their escape from Botany Bay.
They had been supplied with a quadrant, a compass, a
chart, and some small arms and ammunition, from a
Dutch ship that lay there; and the expedition was conducted
by the Governor's fisherman, whose time of
transportation was expired. He was a good seaman,
and a tolerable navigator. They dragged along the coast
of New South Wales; and as often as the hostile nature
of the savage natives would permit, hauled their boat up
at night, and slept on shore. They met with several
curious and interesting anecdotes in this voyage. In
many places of the coast of South Wales, they found very
good coal; a circumstance that was not before known.
Our men were now beginning to regain their strength;
and Captain Dadleberg of the Rembang Indiaman was
making every possible dispatch with his ship to carry us
to Batavia.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
During this time, the interment of Balthazar, King of
Coupang, was performed with much funeral pomp. The
Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, and all the Europeans
were invited. Six months had been spent in preparations
for this f&ecirc;te, at which an emperor and twenty-five kings
assisted and attended in person with all their body-guards,
standards, and standard-bearers, were present.
When the corpse was deposited in the sepulchre, the
Company's troops fired three vollies, and victuals and
drink were immediately served to four thousand people.</p>

<p>The Dutch and English officers were invited to a very
sumptuous dinner, at a table provided for the emperor
and all the kings. The first toast after dinner was the
dead king's health. Next they drank Mynheer Company's
health, which was accompanied with a volley of
small arms and paterreros. The singularity of Mynheer
Company's health, led us to request an explanation;
when we were informed, they found it necessary to make
them believe that Mynheer Company was a great and
powerful king, lest they should not be inclined to pay
that submission to a company of merchants.</p>

<p>The inaugural ceremony at the installation of the young
king, was performed by his drinking a bumper of brandy
and gunpowder, stirred round with the point of a sword.
After being invested with the regal dignity, he came down
in state, to pay his respects to the governor. As he was
preceded by music, and colours flying, every one turned
out to see him. Amongst the rest was a captive king in
chains, who was employed blowing the bellows to our
armourer, whilst he was forging bolts and fetters for our
prisoners and convicts. Here the sunshine of prosperity,
and the mutability of human greatness, were excellently
pourtrayed.</p>

<p>By a policy in the Dutch, in supplying the petty princes
with ammunition and warlike stores, feuds and dissentions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
are kindled amongst them; and they are kept so completely
engaged in civil war, that they have no time to
observe the encroachments of strangers. That domestic
strife serves likewise amply to supply the slave trade from
the prisoners of both parties. They, however, some
time since, made head against the common enemy, and
forced the Dutch to retire within their trenches.</p>

<p>It is the custom, in this climate, to bathe morning and
evening. A fine river, which runs in the centre of the
town, is conveniently situated for that purpose; and we
availed ourselves of it when our strength would permit.
Nature has been profusely lavish, in producing, in the
neighbourhood of this place, all the varied powers of
landscape that the most luxuriant fancy can suggest.
But, while enjoying the picturesque beauties of the scene,
or sheltering in the translucent stream from the fervour
of meridian heat, you are suddenly chilled with fear,
from the terrific aspect of the alligator, or crested snake,
and a number of venomous reptiles, with which this
country abounds. There is one in particular called the
cowk cowk; it is the most disgusting looking animal that
creeps the ground, and its bite is mortal. It is about a
foot and a half long, and seems a production between the
toad and lizard. At stated periods it makes a noise
exactly like a cuckoo clock. Even the natives fly from it
with the utmost horror. The alligators are daring and
numerous. There are instances of their devouring men
and children when bathing in the shallow part of the river
above the town.</p>

<p>The Governor, Mynheer Vanion, relates a circumstance
that happened to him while hunting. In crossing a shallow
part of the river, his black boy was snapped up by an
alligator; but the Governor immediately dismounted,
rescued the boy out of his mouth, and slew him.</p>

<p>The natives of Timor are subject to a cutaneous disease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
during their infancy, something similar to the small pox,
but of longer duration. It seldom terminates fatally,
and only seizes them once in their lives.<a name="FNanchor_165-1" id="FNanchor_165-1"></a><a href="#Footnote_165-1" class="fnanchor">[165-1]</a></p>

<p>On the 6th of October, we embarked on board the
Rembang Dutch Indiaman, taking with us the prisoners
and convicts. Our crew became very sickly in passing the
Straits of Alice [Allas]. We had frequent calms and sultry
weather until the 12th. In passing the island of Flores, a
most tremendous storm arose. In a few minutes every
sail of the ship was shivered to pieces; the pumps all
choaked, and useless; the leak gaining fast upon us;
and she was driving down, with all the impetuosity
imaginable, on a savage shore, about seven miles under
our lee. This storm was attended with the most dreadful
thunder and lightning we had ever experienced. The
Dutch seamen were struck with horror, and went below;
and the ship was preserved from destruction by the manly
exertion of our English tars, whose souls seemed to catch
redoubled ardour from the tempest's rage. Indeed it is
only in these trying moments of distress, when the abyss
of destruction is yawning to receive them, that the
transcendent worth of a British seaman is most conspicuous.
Nor would I wish, from what I have observed
above, to throw any stigma on the Dutch, who I believe
would fight the devil, should he appear in any other shape
to them but that of thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, that the Straits of Alice are not
so dangerous as those of Sapy [Sapi], and are for many
reasons preferable; but it is so intricate a navigation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
that a Dutchman bound from Timor to Batavia, after
beating about for twelve months, found himself exactly
where he first started from.</p>

<p>On the 21st, we got through Alice, and saw three prow-vessels,
who are a very daring set of pirates that infest
those seas. On the 22nd, saw the islands of Kangajunk
and Ulk, and run through the channel that is between
them. Next day we saw the island of Madura.</p>

<p>On the 26th, saw the island of Java; and on the 30th,
anchored at Samarang.</p>

<p>Immediately on our coming to anchor, we were agreeably
surprised to find our tender here which we had so
long given up for lost. Never was social affection more
eminently pourtrayed than in the meeting of these poor
fellows; and from excess of joy, and a recital of their
mutual sufferings, from pestilence, famine, and shipwreck,
a flood of tears filled every man's breast.</p>

<p>They informed us, the night they parted company
with us, the savages attacked them in a regular and powerful
body in their canoes; and their never having seen a
European ship before, nor being able to conceive any idea
of fire-arms, made the conflict last longer than it otherwise
would; for, seeing no missive weapon made use of, when
their companions were killed, they did not suspect any
thing to be the matter with them, as they tumbled into
the water. Our seven-barrelled pieces made great havoc
amongst them. One fellow had agility enough to spring
over their boarding-netting, and was levelling a blow with
his war-club at Mr. Oliver, the commanding-officer, who
had the good fortune to shoot him.</p>

<p>On not finding the ship next day, they gave up all
further hopes of her, and steered for Anamooka, the
rendezvous Captain Edwards had appointed. Their distress
for want of water, if possible, surpassed that of our
own, and had so strong an effect on one of the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
gentlemen, that the day following he became delirious,
and continued so for some months after it.</p>

<p>They at last made the island of Tofoa, near to Anamooka,
which they mistook for it. After trading with
the natives for provisions and water, they made an attempt
to take the vessel from them, which they always will to a
small vessel, when alone; but they were soon overpowered
with the fire arms. They were, however, obliged to be
much on their guard afterwards, at those islands which
were inhabited.</p>

<p>After much diversity of distress, and similar encounters,
they at last made the reef that runs between New Guinea
and New Holland, where the <i>Pandora</i> met her unhappy
fate; and after traversing from shore to shore, without
finding an opening, this intrepid young seaman boldly
gave it the stem, and beat over the reef. The alternative
was dreadful, as famine presented them on the one hand,
and shipwreck on the other. Soon after they had passed
Endeavour Straits, they fell in with a small Dutch vessel,
who shewed them every tenderness that the nature of
their distress required.</p>

<p>They were soon landed at a small Dutch settlement;
but the governor having a description of the <i>Bounty's</i>
pirates from our court, and their vessel being built of
foreign timber, served to confirm them in their suspicions;
and as no officer in the British navy bears a commission
or warrant under the rank of lieutenant, where, by seal of
office, their person or quality may be identified, they had
only their bare <i>ipse dixit</i> to depend on. They, however,
behaved to them with great precaution and humanity.
Although they kept a strict guard over them, nothing
was withheld to render their situation agreeable; and
they were sent, under a proper escort, to this place.</p>

<p>This settlement is reckoned next to Batavia, and is so
lucrative, that the governor is changed every five years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
The present governor's name is Overstraaten, a gentleman
of splendid taste and unbounded hospitality, who lives
in a princely style; and to the <i>otium dignitate</i> of Asiatic
luxury, has the happiness to join an honest hearty Dutch
welcome.</p>

<p>A regiment of the Duke of Wirtemburg is doing duty
here, amongst whom were several men of rank and
fashion, who shewed us much civility and politeness.</p>

<p>The town is regular and beautiful, and the houses are
built in a style of architecture, which has given loose to
the most sportive fancy. Each street is terminated
with some public building, such as a great marine school,
for the education of young officers and seamen; an
hospital for decayed officers in the Company's service;
churches; the Governor's palace, &amp;c. &amp;c. Here the
<i>utile dulce</i> has not been neglected, and those objects of
national importance are placed in a proper point of view,
as the just pride and ornament of a great commercial
people.</p>

<p>Such is the effect of early prejudices, that, under the
muzle of the sun, a Dutchman cannot exist without
snuffing the putrid exhalations from stagnant water, to
which they have been accustomed from their infancy.
They are intersecting it so fast with canals, that in a year
or two this beautiful town will be completely dammed.</p>

<p>In a few days, we arrived at Batavia, the emporeum
of the Dutch in the East; and our first care was employed
in sending to the hospital the sickly remains of our unfortunate
crew. Some dead bodies floating down the
canal struck our boat, which had a very disagreeable
effect on the minds of our brave fellows, whose nerves
were reduced to a very weak state from sickness. This
was a <i>coup de grace</i> to a sick man on his <i>premier entree</i> into
this painted sepulchre, this golgotha of Europe, which
buries the whole settlement every five years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
It is not the climate I am inveighing against; it is the
Gothic, diabolical ideas of the people I indite.</p>

<p>Were they only Dutchmen who supplied the ravenous
maw of death, it would be impertinence in me to make any
comment on it; but when the whole globe lends its aid
to supply this destructive settlement, and its baneful
effects arising more from the letch a Dutchman has for
stagnant mud than from climate, I hope the indulgent
reader will pardon my spleen, when I tell them professionally
that all the mortality of that place originates
from marsh effluvia, arising from their stagnant canals
and pleasure-grounds.</p>

<p>The Chinese are here the Jews of the East, and as soon
as they make their fortune, they go home. Let the
amateurs of the Republican system read and learn. Be
not surprised when it is observed, that these little great
men, those vile hawkers of spice and nutmegs, exact a
submission that the most absolute and tyrannical monarch
who ever swayed a sceptre would be ashamed of. The
compass of my work will not allow me to be particular;
but I must instance one among many others. When an
edilleer, or one of the supreme council, meets a carriage,
the gentleman who meets him must alight, and make
him a perfect bow in spirit; not one of Bunburry's long
bows, but that bow which carries humility and submission
in it, that sort of bow which every vertebr&aelig; in
an English back is anchylosed against.</p>

<p>In our passage from this to the Cape, before we left
Java, one of the convicts had jumped over board in the
night, and swam to the Dutch arsenal at Honroost. In
passing Bantan, we viewed the relics of Lord Cathcart.
We met nothing particular in passing the island of Sumatra,
but experienced great death and sickness in going through
the Straits of Sunda; and after a tedious passage, arrived
at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
Here we met with many civilities from Colonel Gordon;
a gentleman no less eminent for his private virtues than
his extraordinary military and literary accomplishments.
From his labours, all the host of voyagers and historians
of that part of the globe have been purloining; but it is to
be hoped the world will, at some future period, be favoured
with his works unmutilated.</p>

<p>The town is gay, and from length of habit, the inhabitants
partake much of the manners of Bath; and,
for a short season, behave with the utmost attention and
tenderness. Their dress and customs are more characteristic
of the English than Dutch. An uncommon rage for
building has lately prevailed; and although they cannot
boast of that chastity of style in which Samarang is built
it is gaudy, and calculated to please the generality of
observers.</p>

<p>Allow me to mention the singular manner in which the
monkeys make depredations on the gardens here. They
place a proper piquet, or advanced guard, as sentinels,
when a party is drawn up in a line, who hand the fruit from
one to another; and when the alarm is given by the
piquet-guard, they all take flight, making sure that by
that time the booty is conveyed to a considerable distance.
But should the piquet be negligent in their duty, and
suffer the main body to be surprised, the delinquents
are severely punished.</p>

<p>The same ill-fated rage for canalling-murder prevails
here. They have even contrived to carry canals to the
top of a mountain. The boors, or country-farmers, are a
species of the human race, so gigantic and superior to the
rest of mankind, in point of size and constitution, that
they may be called nondescripts.</p>

<p>Their hospital, as to scite, surpasses any in the world.
It may be observed, however, that the architect, by the
smallness of the windows, which only serve to exclude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
the light and air, seems to have studied, with much
ingenuity, to render it a cadaverous stinking prison.</p>

<p>After being refreshed at the Cape, we passed St. Helena,
the island of Ascension, and arrived at Holland; and had
the happiness, through the interposition of divine Providence,
to be again landed on our native shore.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_165-1" id="Footnote_165-1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_165-1"><span class="label">[165-1]</span></a> This seems to be the earliest description of Yaws (<i>Framb&oelig;sia</i>) in
these islands. Originating in Africa this contagious disease is believed
to have been disseminated by the slave trade. The Dutch or Portuguese
traders carried it from Madagascar and East Africa to Ceylon,
where it still bears the name of <i>Parangi Lede</i>, or Foreigners' Evil.
Though Hamilton did not observe it in the South Sea Islands the
disease was probably there, for Mariner, who was in Tonga in 1810,
described it as a well-established disease under the name of <i>Tona</i>.</p></div>
